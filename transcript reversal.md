Unsc covers, the continuation moves which one to buy? 

Where to buy? 

How much to buy where to play? 

Stop. 

Now let me come to the reversal moves. 

Which what what are reversion modes if this is the stock going up? 

And then comes down like this. 

And you buy your and it goes out. 

You got a reversal on a bigger frame, you the continuation. 

No. 

But within that you bought a stock which was an uptrend, but you got at the point where it was down a lot and then it reverse direction. 

That's one reversal second something which is in a already. 

Very studied down Trend like Paytm, for example, and you buy your, and this is what it does. 

This is what a reversal moving, which many knower like, they will call that. 

This is a falling knife, right? 

Never catch of falling. 

My all that. 

This is what you again, studied red or what that falling lies, a dangerous can cut you and all that. 

There are many following lines in this market. 

There are many following lines in this market because the truly 17 names of the highest obviously, there are many polynives but yeah this is what your right that avoid the please. 

All in the classification case of stock in a very very bearish trend, right? 

Truly, when I where I buy Paytm, I get lot of messages on the light on on my Twitter that Truly when I where I buy Paytm, I get lot of messages on the light on on my Twitter that I am, I'm getting over falling, I for unsto, whatever. 

But the, if you remember the foundation that we discussed yesterday, how many days is been down 67, right? 

What is the maximum that you feel in? 

So far there will be more than seven also. 

But so far, what is the maximum value 7 is on a higher side or normal size. 

So if this is a very high probability zone of flowing down and maybe bouncing a little then why not play the trade if you don't adopt the strategy, if you only by triangle copper angle, continuation moves that we discussed you will be out of business for a very long time with the market fall that exactly what is happening right now. 

This market is full of mob like this. 

This market is full of mob like this. 

So u idhar, a two choices use either. 

You don't learn this. 

You only wait for this, but this waiting in will mean that we have only right now. 

Few days stock will do this next few days, it will do. 

Few days stock will do this next few days. 

It will do this. 

And then it will from this formation. 

So which means is it going to happen by tomorrow? 

There are there are there are people who say that we only work for a month at all. 

There are there are there are people who say that we only work for a month at all. 

And absolutely we should do that. 

In fact, these are two set of the worker and you can maximum you can maximize your gained by working only for a condition market like when the market and offers you so many names like this right now, the market is only offering you maybe one or two names like this and when the market offer only one or two continuation does not healthy market, you need a health market where aur many names are lining up together. 

That's a sign that market is about to break out the stock to break out. 

So you can you have a choice to wait for this and only work for them or you learn reversal. 

Also include buying falling knife, Gautam bound excessive weakness and maybe add to your bottom line during this bag market. 

Also, because yesterday I showed you that even in a downfall, you keep getting what the market ralis. 

After like in the entire pet hai Paytm from After like in the entire pet hai Paytm, from here to here, you have small small. 

Yes or no. 

Yes, yes, no. 

When I stop ATM down so many days. 

I selected in my watchlist the next day. 

So, the next day, similarly, I might find more name. 

I'll add that. 

Those names. 

Also, like, I had a continuation list. 

I might have a long reversal. 

This. 

Also, let's say we added 56 names. 

The next morning.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
And that the set of is even got sweet of And that the set of is even got sweet of, it's not something that you should stay away from eyes of Paytm is a very high volumes of util. 

Even do a huge eyes. 

Also, in this selected, this stock on Monday for Monday, and Monday did not reverse there was I tell you how went to buy Monday. 

I should select, right. 

I should select right make friends. 

So this is how I select candidates. 

I look first which are down a lot per 765 days. 

Sometimes you will have small delt but 67 days in a row. 

Sometimes you have, if you go through the set of sentence will have only three days. 

Like this is only three days but the stock is in a very, very strong uptrend. 

I'll cover your examples. 

I will request them detail ID or so many days. 

So around three to four days, what I minimum look for. 

So around three to four days, what I minimum look for. 

But if I get 7 and eight, then I get really excited. 

I am not Paytm on this day today. 

Let's say today's Monday evening, I have out in the morning, so I play. 

Now this is good Monday evening. 

Now this is good Monday evening, the daily chart. 

This is the third look like and this is how the intraday chart website. 

I have opened three minutes, don't get 68 on three or five or one, and only opening a smaller frame to execute my trade. 

So what I need is now if this is Monday evening, what are the three possibilities that Paytm can do tomorrow? 

Care? 

Only, three per possible options. 

It can either open Aaya. 

Small gap, big gap. 

It can you the open higher? 

If anyone open flat or it will open even low, what is that one out of the tree option which one new things will link? 

Make the set of even better? 

Big gap down? 

Yes, if it is stretched. 

Imagine this is a rubber band and you can on or maybe a spring not or above badminton. 

If it's a spring you stretched, there is a point you can't go beyond that and if you leave it it retract, right? 

That called mean reverse in the basically retracts if it is very good set of here tomorrow morning. 

If it gaps down that stretching the spring, right? 

That increases the that improves the set of even more, right? 

So next morning, within the first three minutes, Look at the small fall. 

The fall was very slow and Look at the small fall. 

The fall was very slow and study. 

This is your largest fall. 

Largest bar to how much this look at visually, it's a big gap down, right? 

Is there some big cat down? 

So, on looking at the past in the, all these candles, this is the biggest overwhelming climate. 

And if you don't understand this, let me make is very for you. 

I just inverted the chart. 

If you were buying here, what would you do here after this bar? 

You fell. 

What is the right thing that you should do here? 

What is the right thing that you should do here mild? 

So this is the candidate for me, that I have interested in. 

At this point, I'm interested in buying Paytm, but if tomorrow, it gap down, I am going to jump on it. 

Depending on how, how great that back the gap down. 

Is this is this clearly looks like the largest bar climax, bar, and you have already started on the long side. 

The some work they have studied and found that this is the end of the move. 

The some work they have studied and found that this is the end of the move. 

So, if on the self, this is how this falling for me. 

This is the end of spelling so I did not. 

Wait, this is 14 then and this is 14 Jan, 9:15 the first three minutes and I bottled a 929. 

I was in, I bought it as market, it was around by the time I calculate the quantity which usually take some few seconds. 

And also don't just believe that this is the trade exhibition time. 

Okay, let me yes. 

Yes. 

Now you have Lear Now you have learned Now you have learned because like I should show you that you so far. 

You knew that buying your break out as buying rubber rectangle, buying buying above any cup, the highest point of the cup. 

But I showed you that you don't need to do that.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
Char also you so far most people you know I mean you know that if you need to buy you need to wait for some green candle to appear and probably cross the high of the day. 

And then by this is what you, no, right, you wait for some, some stabilization you wait for some green bar to calm and let the day high get crossed because you think that that's the confirmation that the trend is stabilizing, right? 

So why do I need So, why do I need one02? 

One two, I mean, why do I wait for this? 

You can there is no harminate. 

But if I am, I audit here 10005.50, I am buying your, you are buying here. 

You miss approximately this much. 

If I buy here I make money. 

If I buy here, I make money idhar. 

No guarantees. 

And why should I pay for two confirmations then? 

You a smarter conservation. 

You a smarter conservation and only there is a price for confirmation. 

You can keep waiting for conversation. 

There is a price for it, pain for it, even after being for all the prices, if all those confirmation there is no guarantee that you yes or no. 

So entered as market. 

And here what should my stop loss? 

Be what should my hobl be? 

Because the law of the days is your you don't have to really get into low of the 10, all the give some 2% room because two, three by two, three person because the band is already stretched and this is a big gap down, this is the big gap down. 

Now, it further stress, give two three%, your starting with three focuses on you guys. 

Give three four% for Anand. 

Gradually cut down. 

Where every few days we just, I I entered 10005 when I give a two working stopped and then in the spray to God, because beyond this, you can't do anything. 

Just wait for your analysis to be right within the intraday itself from here. 

The stock is 7%. 

And in the next, this is not within few minutes. 

This was 924 and this is 948 by the end of the day, it was this move. 

13% 14% with the two person, stop seven times next day, event higher for those. 



13:30
I told Aur whatever left, whatever position I had. 

So in this entire fall I made good money on Paytm here because of this reversal concept and nothing I bought again on this day let me remove these purple, let me okay, clarify what we purs are purple Ruth, are these are all big days. 

These are all days which are at least five% when the stock and gone up 5% or down 5% on a one million volume. 

I've already mentioned your see unit and this purpled right under it. 

Because if there are many dors, I know that the stock moves fast in gives many 5% more and it is very, very liquid. 

So, for me because I tried a big account are for me, the equity is a very, very important criteria. 

So if I see many purple dot then, I don't need to really get into this, is a liquid circle or not. 

I can see. 

I am what I am saying is if the stock is down for two days or seven days, is where you make whether they What I am saying is if the stock is down for two days or seven days, is where you make whether they right. 

What I am saying is, if the stock is down for two days or seven days, is where you make whether they, right? 

So, this is, this was the first possibility, where necessardium, where it open, it gap down, even more and how you buy it, which is biote market and give some room and then just wait for the trade to work. 

What about the second possibility in the third possibility in the secondly opening flat? 

I don't trade those revers. 

I don't trade. 

Those are also mostly I am. 

I am getting a big down that my IAS priority. 

My lowest priorities. 

The stock opening flat. 

I am not So the second possibility of I want to pick up down I want to pick up down aur. 

I want a strong start that we have discussed already aur gap up. 

Opening open and your same aur open and low with in one%. 

So these are the examples that are covered. 

Like for example, this is like for this I never opened intraday chart. 

You know this I never open intraday chart here.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
This is this is today let's say this is Sunday, this is Friday and now your analyzing the stock is the stock in solid uptrend and then you find the stock which is downst of four day down for three days sometimes you need you get four days in a row sometimes you get one tiny little day. 

So when you have three down days out of four, that's also expectable when you are three down is especially big down is out of four days and the fourth day is very, very tiny. 

That's also this is also accept so it was 14. 

It was 15% down in four days. 

That's why. 

I also mentioned it here. 

It was 15% down and it is in a solid up Trend. 

It doesn't solid uptrend. 

So, these are my reversal. 

This was the reversal candidate. 

The next morning, there is a gap up opening of 2% open and lower. 

Also, same open in lower also same. 

And then you just enter by 9 18, you have all, you can already see how the price action is the way you entered continuation mode. 

The way you entered, whatever examples are shared, you just buy at market now, read this box, 50, 15% down in four days. 

Three big days out of four, stopping strong uptrend with volume and millions. 

Purple, dot purple. 

Lot means the stock is moving whenever it moves. 

It most asked Ek 15% here. 

It moves. 

And whenever it moves, it gives the volume of 1.1 million, 1.6 Mili ki getting volume in millions, is it? 

1.1 million 1.6 Mili ki getting volume in. 

Millions is it? 

Who is who is responsible for Sach volume Institutions. 

Yes, this is the part of continuation. 

You basically buying continuations reversal. 

So big and world and big boy and world. 

I can expect big move. 

This was a priority of my rever because of this strong start. 

I bought it. 

Next example is skeleton, all these names are recent solid uptrend rising, 20, toilet up trend, many purple torch Next example is skeleton. 

All these names are recent solid uptrend, rising, 20, toilet up trend, many purple torch down. 

Five red days in a row. 

There are five red days in a row. 

A good probability of watching five days on the higher side, right? 

You have a gap up opening in and it came down, but never touch the previous day. 

Close, the close here is 54.85, sorry, 55.35 the lowest 50.550, and then imaginary reversed from that point. 

The there is no strong start. 

On the fifth day, there is no strong start on this day. 

Even if there was in the morning, yes, you have gotten stopped out. 

But the next attempted again, the next data tempted again, and this time it never enter previously low. 

And from here on like this soul is moving in the same fashion, four to five days. 

Three to five days. 

What is the move? 

How much is the move? 

And when you learn to buy such stocks with one or two person stop, what is the money that you make? 

How much risk time you may I turn our easily and when you keep repeating that every week, every month, you end up in a smiling and you will be iing guarantee that it will be making a lot of money that you not. 

Wait, with 10% stocks, let's study more name. 

This is kpit 14% down in four days. 

Three big red days out of four stock in UP trend, on big volume. 

So many purple dot. 

The next day started with the gap up, strong start. 

If this is a strong starts and look at advent on, for five, six days, jevar 28% moves, a two persons of 28% more is 14 up to 14 hour and only five days. 

Let's just say that you catch half. 

Not even 14. 

Or let's say you make 7 hour, only entire trade, your risking today. 

You starting with point one once you get better at it, let's say you you go 2.4.5 you end up making from just this much move in. 

Only five, six days. 

This is what you add to your portfolio on your portfolio. 

This is not from the investment. 

This is not, this is not three% on this. 

This is 3% on this 3.5% on this, is this clear? 

The this is the, this is this fast. 

This is how you can grow your account. 

Very fast, is this point, clear?

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
So the whole in this training, the major shift is you, and I mean, before the training, you knew that you should buy a break, only about the highest point of a box of a range of a cup. 

Now, we are buying within this cup within that box within that range and we are only following the three to five days rule and we the major changes we are going with title top, everyone initially Saint messages. 

Me, the types of will mean that you will get stop the lot. 

Yes. 

If you compare with 10% stocks, you will get stopped out but the one if your setup selection is good which will get better with time once that is better, once that you control the your collection you will still get stopped out on some cases. 

But where the ones which work really well? 

This is this fast. 

You can grow your account. 

Have you ever added three, four, five% to your account in this three to four days? 

Before this 8% 9%, I didn't from DC. 

I think some doubt just this will become the new normal for you. 

Adding 23% almost every other day. 

If the market, the full of options, like right now, it is not 17 names in the list is not an market where you get the market, you get reversal. 

But when the market is of options, buying free for getting three person from every trade, back to back in a month. 

There are people Pooja, how much maximum accounting, one month 9% in one month. 

And if you do it consistently, you end up 20% as this guy 20% also. 

So, if you consistently do is a month of month, you end up and triple digits every year. 

And this is something that you do, it only with first half an hour of market action beyond that, you don't need to really do much and it's a since it's a, we do equity only, you can hold stock settle everything. 

Again, I'm getting into the detail of it later, but yeah, let's let's study more examples. 

NIIT 25% down in four days is this is a normal call or on a higher side for big red days in a row. 

Stronger prior of triangle, stop goes in a strong or trend many purple dots on big volume next day. 

This exactly like Paytm. 

If you now this this should need 20 and services. 

This is 28 this is 27th morning. 

Sorry, 27th evening. 

You select this stock and next day, only two things. 

I want either a strong start and what is the next time? 

It should go down your mouth, which will stretch the band further, and then there will be a possibility of mean reversion very fast the next day. 

This is 207. 

So yes, this was So yes, this was and this time it was a strong start is and you would have bought this stock and Golden stopped out which will happen. 

In fact you will have more than I mean most of those but as amazing keep De in check that's not that won't be your problem. 

If at let's say you giving a three of a person in my all means your stop doubt here. 

If at, let's say, you giving a three of a person in my all means your stop doubt here. 

How? 

Right. 

This is your shushk. 

Right. 

This is your shushk dande. 

I want to add one point here revers. 

You can I strongly ad. 

Yes, Yes. 

So obviously when this happens this is already 230. 

You guys are not working market. 

So for you, this trade is not for you. 

It is for people who are still in the market looking in the screen because there are some people who are doing this full time and only this and I have for those people. 

If this is the price action, the which means stock is somewhere here on daily chart the fifth day. 

Yes. 

Or no just like Paytm when I get up. 

And by all means, just like this looks like a climax bar, right? 

If you don't agree, I can invert and now maybe you will agree people. 

First first, someone who is really after 9:30. 

Don't follow this trick. 

This is only for people were actually as the time to watch the market action. 

But now this, you can learn whether lemino whereas this is the climax bar or no, it is a climate, right? 

So just like Paytm, just like P. 

And you have two choices.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
Either you buy at market and made of first I mean early person or if you need one more conservation then you wait for some stabilize. 



13:44
I mean the price stabilize there is a clear buying If you, if you Also, there is no guarantee here also, so, Also, there is no guarantee here also. 

So it's my personality is that by at market on. 

I don't wait for these confirmation Swami and this is also configuration. 

And then the trade work like this, you can see the daily chart event on for three days. 

This is from somewhere or this is I already. 

This is the 26% mov in only day. 

This is the 26% mov in only day. 

Yes, this is also a climax bar and you will take this trade and on this you will get stopped. 

It is not solid up trend, so many big volume days. 

It is not solid up trend. 

So many big volume days and you are someone who are full time. 

Time to watching this stock go up. 

100 comes down, and it does this. 

This is the climax square, what we do and class is also It's also, it's also down four. 

It's also it's also down four days four bar together, right? 

You what will you do l by right? 

You by and market 75 and goes to, it goes to 377 and you're feeling happy 375 with. 

I mean it's going up and not making lot of money but yeah you're not losing anything and then immediately it reverse and stops you out. 

But I have a question if it was good here. 

How is it here? 

And if you have been following me on Twitter or if you ever seen any material from me, I keep saying this. 

Because I'll explain the concept behind it. 

Because I'll explain the concept behind it. 

Because on this bar when sorry, when you got here on this bar, and when you got out here, U, and so many weekends around, right, people were saying that it's a mindset issue. 

If it was never a mindset issue, the trading easier game. 

I agreed, that is the minor financial issue, and which is what you are here to change. 

Now, yes, if you are stopped down your fearful but neutrally, if you observe this top, so get your position. 

If just you analyze this stock, if this is good, here it is, better your right better here, right? 

And it many weekends around person. 

A who got here. 

He's out. 

And along with this so many people like him. 

You have to do it like a machine. 

I mean, yes, initially, it's not there. 

This is what you have to if just analyze from the neutral markets, point of view, the new neutral point of view. 

Now, lot of week hands are out. 

If it again attend, I know does because we kind of out whenever it goes up it will face let selling pressure because those people who are ready to select every small, right are not in the trade anymore there out, they are not on the trade any more and probably this this is why the second time, it work like a chance. 

And in fact I want the stock should keep failing one or two times and then give a blast because then I increase my size also because And in fact I want the stock should keep failing one or two times and then give a blast because then I increase my size also because I know it's a second attempt to third attempt, I should increase size. 

So these are the things that you will learn with experience, the fear. 

That is one thing that you need to work on which of thisly will take time. 

Next example, is on mobile screen from your h, 20. 

This is the phase 22% down in seven days, seven red days in a row strong or trend. 

Clearly you can see that we are in a strong up trend and many purple dots. 

Big boys or involved. 

You will add it to your work right next morning. 

You will add it to your work right next morning. 

It did a Paytm thing, it opened lower. 

And that is, when you enter at market, in fact it opened lower and the open and lower exactly the same sweeto set up, right? 

And do opening Bell, and on intradayself in one day, self invent 9% higher. 

It did not sustain, probably our, we are booking profit on the way of your selling them. 

We would have sold some money in this move, but I ensured into to show how.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
Even in one day, you got 9%, 9% means. 

Yeah this is this is one of my recent It is the number of days and the percentage move if the percentage move is way to marks. 

It is the number of days and the percentage move if the percentage move is way to marks. 

This one is a very recent trade. 

This one is a very recent trade. 

This is the March 2020 trade on my account also. 

Now, read this 18% down in four days from your one, two, three, four. 

Not normal for a big name like Maruti study. 

You can study the history. 

This is one. 

So this is second, and if you want to study it, these are 14% down moves. 

This is a 15% down move, this is also 10%. 

So 18%, by all means not normal for a large name, something which is has the huge market cap. 

You agree or not. 

You agree or not. 

I either strong start or I either strong start or it should gap down more and give me a trade. 

This is how 7 March opening aur gap down. 

Not like Paytm but not everything will be Paytm. 

If you wait, keep waiting for that. 

That particular bar. 

Then you might not find a reversal range, very often. 

So this is also a gap down. 

Now, what will you do you buy right? 

You buy this stock and give some room. 

Maybe 3%, 4% or 2%? 

Wherever and pray that you don't get shocked out. 

Let's say, I bought it your and or three version stock is, let's say 3% is way to down, let's say you stop only half%. 

I'm not suggesting you take half%, let's say, your stock was only after time and you get stopped out immediately. 

This is just like the example at previous example, we discussed NIIT. 

If you getting stopped out which means that yes you are out but the set of a still getting better and better because getting stretched. 

Yes or no. 

You agree reversal and to be honest, reversals are not as easy as straight up as the continuation moves with discussed, but because we because the markets are bad and there are days when you don't find the setup. 

This is why I am covering the different scenario. 

I think continuation was not going to appear. 

I think continuation was not going to appear so many days could be. 

We also. 

So this is a range, is this is the range? 

This you don't see this as a range. 

This does not look like a into you now. 

Doesn't look like a Institute, and if you sir in break out, you take your chance again. 

You take your chance again. 

And this was your first Chang that stop you out. 

This is your second chance that stopped you out. 

Sorry, this is the second time you buying it. 

It goes up. 

It goes up. 

Saur Marg. 

What happens after four bar to know pause or it can come down but definitely a slow down here. 

Let's say, let's say I'm not working on very, very types of noun. 

Let's say or stop was just just this much you are stopped out again. 

How would the daily chart would look like at this point if it is 1151. 

And this is the daily start. 

This is where the daily would be right? 

Big candle. 

If you don't see it, If you don't see it now you see your range, it's not going down. 

If you are new, you would be scared to go in again because you have been stopped already. 

Like I said, markets are not perfect. 

Not every time you want to get, I measured move right after you buy sometimes. 

There will be lot of drama like this but if you neutralia analyz it, if you forget about what is happened in the past and treat every trade as a new trade, which is not easy. 

Enter on this, break out again because Enter on this, break out again because it has to reverse at some point. 

The law says, I am not saying it. 

The foundation says that you have studied that it will have some point of sometimes it will reverse in one go. 

Like Paytm dead sometime will be lot of drama like this, but if you get projected because of the drama, then your missing lot of money on the TV here. 

You got Maye on this breakout still in the range. 

And finally, it reverse on the third attempt and never look back for three days from here to here. 

Mal beat Bounce back, 12%.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
My stop in Maruti was only 20 points. 

Yeah, she this is the trade. 

Hm. 

I wanted 6560 weather. 

Is from just this much moves. 

Is from just this much moves from just this much more potential. 

Yes, sir. 

24 hour is the potential, but I kept selling on every level. 

Last portion I got out with a 13 or again, and only two days and 13 hour is the list as a.25 again, three% on your account, 3%, on your account. 

Because not, I wanted to showcase that sometime it. 

Because not, I wanted to showcase that sometime. 

It will be lot of stakehouse and world lot of drama and world. 

This time you bought here in the opening Bell, did not work then you about here. 

Also, your happy for a while. 

And the third time into what clearly for this you need screen time and this And the third time into what clearly for this you need screen time and this is not for people don't have time. 

Also, I'd like to add one more thing here again, valid ranges or am I pushing it? 

So if I just if I just review the intraday chart unknown to be in the previous, whatever happened, previous start, let's call it. 

One, two three, what happens after three? 

What happens? 

After three Jameen, what it? 

I think inverting suddenly connect all the d and you start realizing over. 

Now it may it is a tired move if I just observe the intraday it is a tired move. 

So probably this is why Maruti from your works like a chance? 

It is same for downside upside every side and verified don't believe me probably. 

If you know this concept on the third base, you can go really heavy if you on the screen. 

And if you spot this third base, you know, the stock is down a lot on a bigger frame tension here on a bigger frame. 

The stock is down a lot on a smaller frame, Anas smaller Prem you have three bases old rally down rally? 

And if you combine both together what is the one outcome that is value. 

Highly IP but it simple. 

Common sense. 

That's not I That's not. 

There is no way to critic that impossible to credit that, but yes, you can big moves. 



14:04
Every entire market is down and the entire market reverse together, which is was the case. 

Get big moves. 

So now let us So now let us and it will give you lot of the vessel tray. 

And if the signs are good, if the first day lot of reversal closes and the high of the day, you expect they Move Like for example on the same day on the same Maruti ne I Hero Motor. 

Also, the reason is actually the same, the date is also the same. 

The date is also the same. 

This is eight March, this is eight, March. 

Everything was in working together and everything worked in a same fashion. 

The reversal was spint and Hero, Moto trade is also here, you know? 

Okay. 

Yeah, this is the trademarks eight marks. 

I bought, I saw range just like Maruti two. 

Stocks are same sector down a lot on daily forming. 

A range on small. 

What do you do about them together and both work and both money? 

Only two days? 

That's why I the entire March money came from. 

Just these reversal again from from Maruti then, around this I had more trail, you can go and check on my wall. 

So if you not reading the vesselves, then you will be out of business in this market that we are in. 

If you include reversal, then you have to potential to make the same are entire. 

I likes reverses more than continuations because for me personally it's not true for everybody because I do size and I need to buy in good quantity. 

So I have a strong preference of binosonic over this. 

So I have a strong preference of binosonic over this, a small account. 

So this is how I by reversal. 

Also, if you don't understand the description, you can discuss it. 

Also, if you don't understand the description, you can discuss it. 

We are already. 

They passed the meeting time. 

I am still left with the trading log, which is the most important factor. 

I will spend. 

There are few things. 

I mean, I can go on and make videos for six months and there will be still something or the other some content I can keep creating.

There is no into it to decide. 

But now for now I am talking about trading loss for 2 minutes. 

But now, for now I am talking about trading loss for 2 minutes before we have up for today. 

So this is my lock sheet. 

I enter immediately I enter immediately if you working you please and try and enter by the end of the day, do not put it to the end of week. 

You will most likely like not have developedly habit of maintaining the general at. 

So that when did you see the turn around coming into in your trades after starting my dress? 

So that, when did you see the turn around coming into in your trades after starting my dress? 

And how did you? 

So when I was So when I was about doctor alight, l here l means long, long mean buying. 

So I right l, we are only doing cash, so business spelling involved. 

But this cheated design, you can you write f? 

It will to the calculation on this short side. 

So, So, I don't know whether this will convert into a delivery or an intraday and also the same day of first, when I started our right eye and write the symbol, what the name of the stock, just write one here, right? 

One year lot size is the number of shares you buy. 

Let's say about 57 and I bought it on 9th, August, 2019 at this price. 

Let's rent or this l, i Dr. 

Reddy. 

Yeah. 

So I I doctor is I am bored at one about 50 shares. 

I have date of buying is this. 

And I'm bored that this is my gross price. 

This column automatically calculate this column automatically calculate no brokerage the final price. 

The commission is already mentioned here. 

These are my automation you can change, then this is your account size, then it automatically calculate the the price including all the charges and all that here. 

You don't know yourself date. 

You don't know the shelted because the tree. 

It is just open, right? 

Right. 

Open your you don't know the cell price. 

Also. 

Okay let's come back to this challenge. 

I'll date later. 

Let's write initial. 

Stop initial stock is what you take this trade. 

You got it at 4785 and let's say your stock is 4760. 

4764 and this. 

4764. 

And this column is the column where you write down. 

Original allocation is 24% and This you are risking point 13. 

This you are risking point 13 of your account. 

I'll explain you why. 

I am writing me. 

Things manually. 

Coming back to this. 

I don't know my date because the trade is open. 

Obviously, I don't know my surprise because are not sold it. 

So I do it. 

Write open here and here, I write the price where my stop is at this moment. 

So that my sheet calculate, my worst case scenario, my worst case scenario is point 13%. 

The stock is the The stock is the to 5000 200 points up. 

Will you not? 

You will write. 

So, let's say I am raising my stop to 4850. 

Now, look at this. 

I am making point three. 

So my worst, even if I get out of the trade, I am making point three. 

If I don't write this column, the sheet does not calculate my worst case scenarios. 

It is still. 

So I me point one3 which is not true. 

I am getting out at 4850 trailing stop. 

Basically if you don't put in the training, stop the truth picture of where, how much your open risk is. 

Yeah, so if you don't update the trading stop here this then you don't get the true picture of how much your open risk open risky. 

Something open test simply means that if tomorrow market gap down and everything was down that amount you will lose As Long As You trade as a stop level. 

So knowing this where you stand is very important and this is where I feel lot of people not. 

So in this they don't update this problem. 

This is do it on the day when they finally choses. 

If this position goes on for 20 days, you yourself that you are received.13, but you are not actually risking point three, you are making money. 

If this goes to 4900, you are making.55 on your account, 0.55% on your account. 

So keep updating it and which is why I added initial stop. 

And where did you finally close it? 

This is why you should stop.

Vin.AI, [30-12-2025 14:18]
And where did you finally close it? 

This is why you should stop column is there for the only reason and tomorrow there are there are good. 

There is a good likely or that you will not close this position at one price, you will be selling at different prices on different days or happens, right? 

You bath, you got 50 shares that but you still tension that 49 105100 different rate, right? 

If you club all the selling into one, will it give you a true picture? 

Because if I told tensioners on 10th, August ensures and 11th August on 12th August and then finally, some shares last 15th August, but if I claught everything together and write the average price, it will say that I was holding the entire position when you studies two months. 

Later, 3 months later, you will see that you sold everything on 15th August and you were holding a position for seven days. 

That's not a, it will not give your true picture, right? 

That's you maintaining the lock sheet wrong. 

The true picture will only be come out if you split your entry in the same ratio of your selling. 

For example, I got 50 shares. 

But I told out of those 50, as old 10, after four days and this 50 become 40 because now only 40 or pending 40 or open. 

And finally, I told these 40 shares on 17000 at, let's say 5000. 

Now I have a better picture. 

I sold 10 shares, I would 57, I hold, I was holding those tenure for provided and remaining I held for 9 days. 

If you club your entry, you will not get it. 

So you need to splited. 

This is my I noted down the original because right, splitting it, this column has changed. 

It was 24% here also because splitting but now this has changed. 

So I manually this right. 

What is now is then I can study, how many treasure taken in a month in a year and all that. 

And these are the filters with which you can separate your winners will loser. 

Like, for example, if I want to only study loser, just go to this column. 

These are the apine. 

If it is about zero, that means the winning trade. 

If it is below zero, it is a losing interest simple. 

So just filter click on this Arrow going to custom filter in greater than zero. 

If you do zero I get all the winners of this month. 

I can also do a date, filtration, I only want August month, trade. 

And then get, I get all my winners and I can calculate how much on an average I'm making on winners. 

How much average allocation I'm making on all these winners. 

This is my allocation on dinner. 

Similarly, I can start my losers, change it to less than zero. 

I get all the losers together. 

Now, I will charge one million rupees extra for sharing the sheet. 

It's a joke. 

Obviously, I'm sharing all this material that have covered here, all the slide, all the Excel sheets, all my trading view, layouts all the Spider layouts, all the spiders can and all the effort that I can extra. 

So this is it. 

If meet we i'l make a detail video on the trading, I don't think there is required. 

If it is confusion, you can deliver
