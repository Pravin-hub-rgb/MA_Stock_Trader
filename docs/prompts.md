For questions and answer sections: 

## Key Features:

- __Hierarchical Structure:__ Clear parent-child relationships
- __Logical Organization:__ Grouped by trading context and purpose
- __No Extra Content:__ Only rules and concepts from the transcripts so don't add from your side
- __Trading Context:__ Organized for practical application


Perfect! Now I understand exactly what you want. You want:

1. **Theory Section First** - A cohesive overview that introduces all key concepts
2. **Gist of Points** - Brief summary of what will be covered in detail  
3. **Detailed Points** - Each numbered point elaborates on the concepts introduced in the theory

This way there's no repetition, just a natural flow from overview to details.

## New Structure:

### **Theory Section**
A cohesive paragraph covering:
- Strong start is essential for trade selection
- If no strong start, avoid the trade (weak stock principle)
- Trading time constraints determine what opportunities you can pursue
- Focus only on what fits within your system and timeframe
- Don't worry about opportunities outside your defined parameters

### **Key Principles**
Brief bullet points summarizing what will be covered:
- Core principle: Strong start requirement
- Practical application: When no strong start
- Timeframe considerations: 80-20 rule
- System focus: Stay within parameters
- Conclusion: Work within constraints

### **Detailed Points**
Each numbered point then elaborates on one principle from the theory section.

This structure provides:
- **No Repetition:** Theory introduces concepts, points elaborate
- **Natural Flow:** Overview → Summary → Details
- **Clear Connection:** Each point clearly relates back to the theory
- **Logical Progression:** Builds understanding step by step

Would you like me to restructure it this way?

The answer now flows naturally with a conversational tone, making it much easier to read and understand while maintaining all the essential points from the transcript.
