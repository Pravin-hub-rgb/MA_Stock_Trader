Hey Vin, alright bro—sorry for the overload earlier. Let's strip it down and get on the same page.

From what Manas has shared publicly (his recent posts on Oops, older reversal threads, and examples like Paytm), the two main **distinct methods** he talks about for these kinds of entries are indeed:

1. **Strong Start (SS)**  
   - From his 2022-era bootcamp/content and mentions (e.g., "Busted, SS, surfing key MAs" in replies).  
   - Core idea: Early-day strength showing buyer control right away.  
   - Typical signs: Minor gap up / flat-strong open, open ≈ low (no early selling/dip), quick reclaim, volume pop in first few minutes.  
   - Used for anticipatory entries on reversals, breakouts, or pullbacks—buyers dominate from bell.  
   - Not tied to gap-down fakeouts; can be on flat/gap-up days too.

2. **Oops Reversal**  
   - His more recent formalized setup (he published an "OOPS REVERSAL indicator" in July 2025).  
   - Specifically for **gap-down days** from "noisy events" (panic/news fakeouts).  
   - Key rule: Wait 3-4 mins post-open before hitting SL on longs (or entering).  
   - The "oops" moment: Early weakness reverses, and it becomes a buy opportunity.  
   - Confirmation often involves reclaiming levels—**he highlights cases where the day turns strong after gap-down**, and in some examples/context, crossing **previous day's close** acts as a clean trigger to confirm the fakeout (sellers trapped, buyers in).  
   - He doesn't always demand prev high (as we discussed earlier, too aggressive); prev close is more realistic/practical for many cases.

Now, about the **climax bar thing** (big red bar/volume surge in first 3-5 mins on small TF, like in Paytm 2022 entry):  
Yes, that's part of his older reversal playbook (early exhaustion proof).  
But he **evolved** it into Oops Reversal as a structured way to handle gap-downs:  
- Climax bar = good early signal (panic exhaustion).  
- But Oops adds the **wait + reclaim level** (like prev close cross) to filter better and avoid jumping too soon on partial fakes.  
- In short: Climax is still useful (especially for timing), but **Oops is the improvement** he brought in later—focusing on the fakeout narrative and a specific confirmation level (prev close reclaim) instead of just "big red bar + reverse fast".  
- Why bring up Oops? To make it more reliable/asymmetric: Wait avoids whipsaw, prev close cross gives clear "sellers done" vote, turns potential exits into entries.

**Common ground we agree on?**  
Yes—**only two primary methods right now**: SS and Oops Reversal.  
- SS = early strength gate (anticipatory, works on various opens).  
- Oops = gap-down fakeout play (wait 3-4 mins, confirm via reclaim like prev close).  
- Climax bar is **not a separate third method**; it's a supporting clue (early exhaustion) that can boost either SS or Oops setups.

If we forget streaks/trend for now (as you said), the bot can simply scan for gap-down candidates (Oops) or strong-open candidates (SS), then apply the respective rules.

Sound right? If yes, next—how do you want to prioritize between SS and Oops in the live flow? (e.g., gap-down = prefer Oops; no gap but SS = go; or always check both?) Let's lock that. 😄


Hey Vin! No, we don't **really need** to force a rigid division by trend (uptrend pullback vs downtrend mean reversion) or consecutive red days (3-6 vs >=7) for every setup. From Manas Arora's public posts and examples (2025 Oops mentions, SS tags in replies, mean reversion calls like KAYNES/IndiGo), he doesn't strictly bucket trades that way—it's more about **context + setup fit** than hard rules.

### Does He Play Differently Based on Trend?
Not explicitly like "uptrend = always SS priority, downtrend = always Oops priority." He adapts based on what's in front of him, but patterns emerge:

- **Uptrend/Strong Momentum Names** (pullbacks or resumptions): He leans heavily on **Strong Start (SS)** for anticipatory entries. Many SS mentions (e.g., replies tagging SS on entries like SVRO upgrade, Hblengine pullback, Cochin, etc.) are in stocks showing early strength, often after minor dips or shakeouts in otherwise solid trends. He prioritizes SS when buyers show control early—no deep gap needed. Oops rarely gets tagged here because gap-down fakeouts are less common in strong uptrends (more continuation plays).

- **Downtrend/Extended Fall/Mean Reversion** (oversold snaps like Paytm-style): He uses **Oops Reversal** more prominently for gap-down days after noisy events or panic. His 2025 posts push Oops indicator exactly for these (wait 3-4 mins on gap-down, turn into buy if reverses—e.g., Nifty June 13 Oops, RVNL lesson). Mean reversion calls (KAYNES, IndiGo "classic mean reversion brewing," KAYNES better than IndiGo) often involve crisis/opportunity in weakness, where gap-down + reversal fits Oops perfectly. SS shows up less in pure downtrends because early strength is rarer—sellers dominate bell unless exhaustion flips it fast.

### The 4 Variations (But We Don't Need to Over-Divide)
Yes, technically 4 combos exist (uptrend + gap-down, uptrend + no gap, downtrend + gap-down, downtrend + no gap), but Manas doesn't treat them as separate "strategies"—he just picks the fitting tool:

- **Uptrend + Gap-Down** → Oops if fakeout (rare, but possible in noisy pullback; wait + reclaim).
- **Uptrend + No Gap/SS** → SS priority (his bread-and-butter anticipatory entries).
- **Downtrend + Gap-Down** → Oops priority (mean reversion fakeout, wait 3-4 mins, prev close reclaim).
- **Downtrend + No Gap** → Rare/lower odds; maybe skip or need strong SS/climax proof (not his main play).

Bottom line: **No need for forced division** in your bot if it complicates things. Just use the open as the splitter (gap-down → Oops mode first; no gap → SS mode first). Trend/context can be a soft filter (e.g., boost priority in uptrend for SS, require extra proof in downtrend for Oops) without making 4 rigid buckets. He plays the setup that matches the day/environment—mindset over labels.

If we skip trend/days entirely for simplicity, the bigger picture stays clean:  
- Gap down? → Oops first (wait, reclaim prev close).  
- No gap? → SS first (early strength).  

That captures 90% of his vibe without over-engineering. Does ditching the divisions feel better, or want to keep a light trend filter? 😄


umm

thinking about logically and price action based and mean reversion

well that >=7days should we played with always oops 

and another thing should we let go if gap up happens?

well we have priority based right cuse oops will be prefered here then after it comes the SS thing right .. if gap down didn't happened then we have to go with rules of SS



so if we think in perspective of mean revresion well that >=7 days thing always goes with priority of oops 

so i think no division on for >=7 days???

then we are left with 3 to 6 

sometimes it seems like i'm over complicating it ... cuse Manas never talked about day range specifically division well... he said he usually look for 3 to 4 days but if he gets like more than that he plays that gap down thingy ... 

but i don't know if that gapdown thing applies to all or its just specific to longer days streak i don't know 

so what we do here?

we remove all division like trend and days range 

and just prioirties oops before SS??

like we have 5 stocks to observe live okay

well as i can let's say take 2 trade a day 

so out of 5 i have to pick 2

and let's say 3 did gap down , 1 did flat (rejected) , 1 did gap up 

now as we are waiting for first few minutes ... 

we are now obeserving only 4

now it becomes complex see 

well cuse the 3 did gap down so these are candidate of oops so we have to wait until the price comes back up to cross the prev close .. well this can happen any time right at 10 am, 11 am, 1 pm ... 

and that 1 gap has already qualified at strong start at let's say 9:20 so should we take that or not cuse the prioirty is indeed oops but they have to coming back up they might not .. so what we do here?



Hey Vin! Yeah, logically, from price action and mean reversion angle, it makes sense to **always prioritize Oops for >=7 red days**—that's deep exhaustion where gap down fakeouts shine (Manas' mean reversion calls like KAYNES/IndiGo often come after extended falls, and his Oops indicator is built for noisy gap-down reversals in those spots). No need for separate division there; just flag those as "must-watch for Oops" in watchlist.

For 3-6 days, you're right—Manas doesn't divide explicitly (he mentions looking for 3-4 days down for reversals in posts like his 2022/2023 threads, but for longer streaks/extended falls, he leans into gap-down plays). The gap-down thing isn't exclusive to long streaks; it's for any noisy event, but odds are higher in mean reversion contexts. So, to avoid overcomplicating (since he never talks specific divisions), **remove trend and days range divisions entirely**. Keep it simple: **Prioritize Oops over SS overall**.

### How to Handle Priority in Live Flow
Bot observes all candidates (e.g., your 5 stocks), waits first 3-4 mins for everyone. Then:

- **If gap down**: Oops mode first—wait for reclaim (cross prev close) + strength clues (volume pop, absorption). This can trigger anytime (9:20, 10am, 1pm), but set a cutoff (e.g., by 12pm if no cross, skip to avoid late fakes).
- **If no gap down (gap up/flat)**: SS mode—check early qualifies (open≈low, quick > open, vol surge by 9:20). If yes, enter; if flat rejected, skip.

In your example (3 gap down = Oops candidates; 1 gap up = SS candidate; 1 flat rejected → observe 4):
- At 9:20, if the gap up qualifies SS → **Take it** (early bird, high conviction—Manas uses SS for anticipatory entries in strong setups). You have room for 2 trades, so grab the sure thing without waiting (priority is Oops, but SS is ready now; Oops might fail/miss).
- Continue monitoring the 3 Oops—enter up to 1 more if/when they cross prev close with confirms (e.g., first one at 10am gets it). If none trigger, fine; if 2 do, pick the strongest (e.g., best volume or nearer to mean reversion levels).
- If an Oops flips early to SS traits (quick reclaim), treat as upgraded Oops—enter faster.

This way, no missing early SS while honoring Oops priority (wait for them, but don't pass on ready SS). Manas' vibe is environment + setup fit over rigid order—gap down gets Oops edge, but SS is standalone if no gap. If you limit to 2 trades, bot can sort by strength score (e.g., vol + reclaim speed) post-9:20.

Simplifies everything—no divisions needed. Thoughts—want to add cutoff times or strength scoring next? 😄
