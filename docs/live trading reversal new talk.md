Hey Vin, alright bro—sorry for the overload earlier. Let's strip it down and get on the same page.

From what Manas has shared publicly (his recent posts on Oops, older reversal threads, and examples like Paytm), the two main **distinct methods** he talks about for these kinds of entries are indeed:

1. **Strong Start (SS)**  
   - From his 2022-era bootcamp/content and mentions (e.g., "Busted, SS, surfing key MAs" in replies).  
   - Core idea: Early-day strength showing buyer control right away.  
   - Typical signs: Minor gap up / flat-strong open, open ≈ low (no early selling/dip), quick reclaim, volume pop in first few minutes.  
   - Used for anticipatory entries on reversals, breakouts, or pullbacks—buyers dominate from bell.  
   - Not tied to gap-down fakeouts; can be on flat/gap-up days too.

2. **Oops Reversal**  
   - His more recent formalized setup (he published an "OOPS REVERSAL indicator" in July 2025).  
   - Specifically for **gap-down days** from "noisy events" (panic/news fakeouts).  
   - Key rule: Wait 3-4 mins post-open before hitting SL on longs (or entering).  
   - The "oops" moment: Early weakness reverses, and it becomes a buy opportunity.  
   - Confirmation often involves reclaiming levels—**he highlights cases where the day turns strong after gap-down**, and in some examples/context, crossing **previous day's close** acts as a clean trigger to confirm the fakeout (sellers trapped, buyers in).  
   - He doesn't always demand prev high (as we discussed earlier, too aggressive); prev close is more realistic/practical for many cases.

Now, about the **climax bar thing** (big red bar/volume surge in first 3-5 mins on small TF, like in Paytm 2022 entry):  
Yes, that's part of his older reversal playbook (early exhaustion proof).  
But he **evolved** it into Oops Reversal as a structured way to handle gap-downs:  
- Climax bar = good early signal (panic exhaustion).  
- But Oops adds the **wait + reclaim level** (like prev close cross) to filter better and avoid jumping too soon on partial fakes.  
- In short: Climax is still useful (especially for timing), but **Oops is the improvement** he brought in later—focusing on the fakeout narrative and a specific confirmation level (prev close reclaim) instead of just "big red bar + reverse fast".  
- Why bring up Oops? To make it more reliable/asymmetric: Wait avoids whipsaw, prev close cross gives clear "sellers done" vote, turns potential exits into entries.

**Common ground we agree on?**  
Yes—**only two primary methods right now**: SS and Oops Reversal.  
- SS = early strength gate (anticipatory, works on various opens).  
- Oops = gap-down fakeout play (wait 3-4 mins, confirm via reclaim like prev close).  
- Climax bar is **not a separate third method**; it's a supporting clue (early exhaustion) that can boost either SS or Oops setups.

If we forget streaks/trend for now (as you said), the bot can simply scan for gap-down candidates (Oops) or strong-open candidates (SS), then apply the respective rules.

Sound right? If yes, next—how do you want to prioritize between SS and Oops in the live flow? (e.g., gap-down = prefer Oops; no gap but SS = go; or always check both?) Let's lock that. 😄


Hey Vin! No, we don't **really need** to force a rigid division by trend (uptrend pullback vs downtrend mean reversion) or consecutive red days (3-6 vs >=7) for every setup. From Manas Arora's public posts and examples (2025 Oops mentions, SS tags in replies, mean reversion calls like KAYNES/IndiGo), he doesn't strictly bucket trades that way—it's more about **context + setup fit** than hard rules.

### Does He Play Differently Based on Trend?
Not explicitly like "uptrend = always SS priority, downtrend = always Oops priority." He adapts based on what's in front of him, but patterns emerge:

- **Uptrend/Strong Momentum Names** (pullbacks or resumptions): He leans heavily on **Strong Start (SS)** for anticipatory entries. Many SS mentions (e.g., replies tagging SS on entries like SVRO upgrade, Hblengine pullback, Cochin, etc.) are in stocks showing early strength, often after minor dips or shakeouts in otherwise solid trends. He prioritizes SS when buyers show control early—no deep gap needed. Oops rarely gets tagged here because gap-down fakeouts are less common in strong uptrends (more continuation plays).

- **Downtrend/Extended Fall/Mean Reversion** (oversold snaps like Paytm-style): He uses **Oops Reversal** more prominently for gap-down days after noisy events or panic. His 2025 posts push Oops indicator exactly for these (wait 3-4 mins on gap-down, turn into buy if reverses—e.g., Nifty June 13 Oops, RVNL lesson). Mean reversion calls (KAYNES, IndiGo "classic mean reversion brewing," KAYNES better than IndiGo) often involve crisis/opportunity in weakness, where gap-down + reversal fits Oops perfectly. SS shows up less in pure downtrends because early strength is rarer—sellers dominate bell unless exhaustion flips it fast.

### The 4 Variations (But We Don't Need to Over-Divide)
Yes, technically 4 combos exist (uptrend + gap-down, uptrend + no gap, downtrend + gap-down, downtrend + no gap), but Manas doesn't treat them as separate "strategies"—he just picks the fitting tool:

- **Uptrend + Gap-Down** → Oops if fakeout (rare, but possible in noisy pullback; wait + reclaim).
- **Uptrend + No Gap/SS** → SS priority (his bread-and-butter anticipatory entries).
- **Downtrend + Gap-Down** → Oops priority (mean reversion fakeout, wait 3-4 mins, prev close reclaim).
- **Downtrend + No Gap** → Rare/lower odds; maybe skip or need strong SS/climax proof (not his main play).

Bottom line: **No need for forced division** in your bot if it complicates things. Just use the open as the splitter (gap-down → Oops mode first; no gap → SS mode first). Trend/context can be a soft filter (e.g., boost priority in uptrend for SS, require extra proof in downtrend for Oops) without making 4 rigid buckets. He plays the setup that matches the day/environment—mindset over labels.

If we skip trend/days entirely for simplicity, the bigger picture stays clean:  
- Gap down? → Oops first (wait, reclaim prev close).  
- No gap? → SS first (early strength).  

That captures 90% of his vibe without over-engineering. Does ditching the divisions feel better, or want to keep a light trend filter? 😄


umm

thinking about logically and price action based and mean reversion

well that >=7days should we played with always oops 

and another thing should we let go if gap up happens?

well we have priority based right cuse oops will be prefered here then after it comes the SS thing right .. if gap down didn't happened then we have to go with rules of SS



so if we think in perspective of mean revresion well that >=7 days thing always goes with priority of oops 

so i think no division on for >=7 days???

then we are left with 3 to 6 

sometimes it seems like i'm over complicating it ... cuse Manas never talked about day range specifically division well... he said he usually look for 3 to 4 days but if he gets like more than that he plays that gap down thingy ... 

but i don't know if that gapdown thing applies to all or its just specific to longer days streak i don't know 

so what we do here?

we remove all division like trend and days range 

and just prioirties oops before SS??

like we have 5 stocks to observe live okay

well as i can let's say take 2 trade a day 

so out of 5 i have to pick 2

and let's say 3 did gap down , 1 did flat (rejected) , 1 did gap up 

now as we are waiting for first few minutes ... 

we are now obeserving only 4

now it becomes complex see 

well cuse the 3 did gap down so these are candidate of oops so we have to wait until the price comes back up to cross the prev close .. well this can happen any time right at 10 am, 11 am, 1 pm ... 

and that 1 gap has already qualified at strong start at let's say 9:20 so should we take that or not cuse the prioirty is indeed oops but they have to coming back up they might not .. so what we do here?



Hey Vin! Yeah, logically, from price action and mean reversion angle, it makes sense to **always prioritize Oops for >=7 red days**—that's deep exhaustion where gap down fakeouts shine (Manas' mean reversion calls like KAYNES/IndiGo often come after extended falls, and his Oops indicator is built for noisy gap-down reversals in those spots). No need for separate division there; just flag those as "must-watch for Oops" in watchlist.

For 3-6 days, you're right—Manas doesn't divide explicitly (he mentions looking for 3-4 days down for reversals in posts like his 2022/2023 threads, but for longer streaks/extended falls, he leans into gap-down plays). The gap-down thing isn't exclusive to long streaks; it's for any noisy event, but odds are higher in mean reversion contexts. So, to avoid overcomplicating (since he never talks specific divisions), **remove trend and days range divisions entirely**. Keep it simple: **Prioritize Oops over SS overall**.

### How to Handle Priority in Live Flow
Bot observes all candidates (e.g., your 5 stocks), waits first 3-4 mins for everyone. Then:

- **If gap down**: Oops mode first—wait for reclaim (cross prev close) + strength clues (volume pop, absorption). This can trigger anytime (9:20, 10am, 1pm), but set a cutoff (e.g., by 12pm if no cross, skip to avoid late fakes).
- **If no gap down (gap up/flat)**: SS mode—check early qualifies (open≈low, quick > open, vol surge by 9:20). If yes, enter; if flat rejected, skip.

In your example (3 gap down = Oops candidates; 1 gap up = SS candidate; 1 flat rejected → observe 4):
- At 9:20, if the gap up qualifies SS → **Take it** (early bird, high conviction—Manas uses SS for anticipatory entries in strong setups). You have room for 2 trades, so grab the sure thing without waiting (priority is Oops, but SS is ready now; Oops might fail/miss).
- Continue monitoring the 3 Oops—enter up to 1 more if/when they cross prev close with confirms (e.g., first one at 10am gets it). If none trigger, fine; if 2 do, pick the strongest (e.g., best volume or nearer to mean reversion levels).
- If an Oops flips early to SS traits (quick reclaim), treat as upgraded Oops—enter faster.

This way, no missing early SS while honoring Oops priority (wait for them, but don't pass on ready SS). Manas' vibe is environment + setup fit over rigid order—gap down gets Oops edge, but SS is standalone if no gap. If you limit to 2 trades, bot can sort by strength score (e.g., vol + reclaim speed) post-9:20.

Simplifies everything—no divisions needed. Thoughts—want to add cutoff times or strength scoring next? 😄

You're absolutely right! I was overcomplicating it. **Strong Start is just an entry method** - it's about HOW you enter, not WHAT you're trading.

So let me correct the priority system:

## **Corrected Priority System:**

### **Priority 1: 7+ Red Days (Regardless of Trend)**
- **Gap Down** → OOPS Reversal entry method
- **Gap Up** → Strong Start entry method
- **Logic**: These are prime mean reversion candidates, just different entry styles

### **Priority 2: 3-6 Red Days + Downtrend**
- **Gap Down** → OOPS Reversal entry method (primary)
- **Gap Up** → Strong Start entry method (secondary)
- **Logic**: Mean reversion plays, OOPS preferred for gap down

### **Priority 3: 3-6 Red Days + Uptrend**
- **Gap Up** → Strong Start entry method (primary)
- **Gap Down** → OOPS Reversal entry method (secondary)
- **Logic**: Could be continuation or pullback reversal, Strong Start preferred

## **The Key Insight:**
- **OOPS Reversal**: Entry method for gap-down scenarios (wait 3-4 min, cross prev close)
- **Strong Start**: Entry method for gap-up/flat scenarios (early strength, open≈low)
- **Both are mean reversion plays** when applied to reversal setups

So for a downtrend with 3-6 red days:
- **Gap Down** → OOPS (wait for reversal confirmation)
- **Gap Up** → Strong Start (buy the early strength as mean reversion)

This makes much more sense! The entry method depends on the gap direction, not the trend direction. Agreed?


Hey Vin! Based on Manas Arora's posts on Oops Reversal (like his July 2025 one where he released the indicator, emphasizing the 3-4 min wait on gap-down days to spot if it flips from SL exit to buy opportunity), the setup is more about the day showing reversal strength after the early panic—often confirmed by reclaiming key levels (prev close is a practical trigger, as it invalidates the downside trap). He doesn't spell out exact "must cross by X time" rules publicly, but his examples (e.g., RVNL Oops lesson, Nifty June 13 2025 reversal) lean toward early-to-mid day recognition for conviction (low holds, absorption starts fast, day closes strong above prev low/close). Late-day crosses can be valid if the structure holds (no new lows broken), but they're riskier—could be fading strength or false hope before close.

### What If It Doesn't Cross Prev Close for Oops?
- **Reject it**: If no cross by EOD (or your cutoff, say 1-2 PM to avoid whipsaw), skip entirely—it's not a true Oops fakeout (sellers weren't trapped enough, reversal failed). Manas stresses the "oops" moment where the gap-down turns bullish; without reclaim, it's just weakness. Invalidate if low breaks further or day closes red/weak (he notes views invalid if Oops day low breached, as in his June 2025 index stops).

- **If It Crosses Later in the Day**: Enter if confirms (e.g., cross at 1 PM with volume surge, low intact, absorption clear)—treat as delayed Oops, but size smaller (partial position) for higher risk (less time for follow-through, potential fade before close). If too late (post-2 PM), reject to avoid holding overnight uncertainty. His mindset: Asymmetric plays only—late cross might not have edge.

### Scenario: 3 Stocks Left (2 Gap Down Oops Waiting for Prev Close Breach, 1 SS Qualified Early)
Don't wait and pass on the SS—**enter the SS first at ~9:20 if it qualifies** (early strength is its edge; Manas uses SS for anticipatory buys in many examples like his 2022-2023 threads). Priority is Oops overall (gap-down fakeouts get first monitoring), but since SS is ready and Oops aren't (waiting for cross), grab SS as trade #1—it's a standalone method, not subordinate. Then continue watching the 2 Oops for trade #2 (enter the first/strongest to cross prev close with clues; if neither does, stop at 1 trade). This honors mean reversion priority (deep streaks get Oops focus) while not missing asymmetric early SS.

If both Oops trigger later, pick based on strength (e.g., higher vol, better low hold). Keeps it simple—test on historicals like Paytm/RVNL to tweak cutoffs. Thoughts on adding a "late cross buffer" (e.g., -0.5% size)? 😄

Hey Vin! Yeah, exactly—this is where it gets practical for the bot/live flow. Both **SS** and **Oops** are designed as **early-entry models** in the first few minutes (Manas emphasizes the 3-4 min wait/post-open observation to catch the real strength or fakeout), but they trigger on different conditions. The key is **not waiting forever** for one while the other is ready—enter whoever qualifies first with conviction, since you have limited trades (2/day max).

### Quick Recap of Entry Triggers (Based on Manas' Style)
- **SS (Strong Start)**: Direct early entry—typically in first 5-15 mins (often by 9:20-9:30).  
  - Qualifies if: Open ≈ low (or minor gap up), quick price > open, high relative volume, no early selling pressure.  
  - Some cases: Break of first few minutes high (or open high) with volume confirms buyer control.  
  - From his examples (Apollo Tyres earnings + SS, ICIL/NSLNISP SS posts): Enter on that early strength—it's anticipatory, not waiting for later crosses.

- **Oops Reversal**: Also early-focused (wait 3-4 mins), but confirmation (prev close cross or strong reclaim) can happen anytime if the day flips.  
  - Core: Gap down → observe first 3-4 mins (no SL hit yet), then if reverses (price starts up, low holds, volume on upside), enter on cross of prev close (or clear strength).  
  - His indicator/posts: Flag the day as Oops if it reverses overall, but entries are on the "oops moment" (early-to-mid day preferred for momentum).

### What If Neither Triggers Early? And Who to Enter First?
In your scenario (e.g., 3 stocks left: 2 gap-down Oops waiting for prev close breach, 1 SS qualified early):

- **Enter the SS immediately** (at ~9:20-9:30 if it breaks first few mins high or shows clear strength)—don't hold back waiting for Oops. SS is a standalone, high-conviction play (early buyer dominance = asymmetric edge). Take it as trade #1. Manas grabs these quickly in strong setups (e.g., his SS-tagged entries like Apollo/NSLNISP were on that initial strength).

- **Keep waiting on the 2 Oops** for trade #2—monitor for prev close cross + confirms (volume surge on up move, no new low break).  
  - If one crosses early (say 9:45-10:30 with good clues) → Enter as #2.  
  - If it takes longer (11 AM or 1 PM) → Still enter if structure intact (low held all day, reversal clear), but size smaller (partial) or skip if too late (e.g., after 1-2 PM cutoff to avoid low follow-through/fade risk). Manas' Oops examples (Nifty June 13, RVNL) show the flip often happens reasonably early for momentum.

- **If no Oops triggers by EOD/cutoff**: Stop at 1 trade (the SS)—better than forcing weak ones.  
  - If Oops triggers first/before SS fully confirms: Take Oops as #1 (since gap-down priority), then see if SS still holds for #2.

Bottom line: **Enter whoever triggers first with solid confirms**—don't make it "wait for all to align" or force Oops over a ready SS. The bot can rank by timestamp + strength (e.g., early SS > delayed Oops). This matches Manas' practical vibe: Catch the edge when it shows (early SS is fast money; Oops is the gap-down trap flip when it happens).

If you want, we can define cutoffs (e.g., Oops must cross by 12 PM) or add a "strength score" (vol + price action) to pick between multiples. What's your gut on handling late Oops crosses—enter partial or hard reject? 😄


final stuff:
This is the definitive answer! The guider has provided the exact execution logic for your scenario. Let me summarize the **FINAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES**:

## **For Your Specific Scenario:**
- **1 Elite (7+ red days + gap down)** → VIP: Absolute priority, hold slots
- **1 Secondary (3-6 red days + downtrend + gap down)** → Backup: Only if VIP fails  
- **2 SS stocks** → **REJECT COMPLETELY**: No entry, no monitoring

## **Execution Flow:**

### **At Open + 3-4 min:**
- **Reject SS stocks immediately** (no slots wasted)
- Monitor both OOPS candidates (VIP and secondary)

### **Entry Decisions:**
1. **If VIP (7+) crosses first** → Take as trade #1, then check secondary for #2
2. **If Secondary (3-6) crosses first** → **DO NOT TAKE** - hold slot for VIP
3. **Only take secondary if:**
   - VIP already entered → Take as #2
   - VIP invalidates (breaks low or fails by 1-2 PM) → Take as #1

### **Key Principles:**
- **Elite Protection**: Never sacrifice 7+ day monsters for weaker setups
- **No Chasing**: If elite doesn't trigger by cutoff, take secondary or end day
- **Patient Waiting**: Hold slots open for late-developing VIP OOPS crosses
- **Daily Max 2**: But prioritize quality over quantity

## **Why This Works:**
- Matches Manas's actual trading (prioritizing deep exhaustion like Paytm/KAYNES)
- Avoids FOMO on missed SS while protecting big winners
- No overcomplication - clear hierarchy with patience for elites

**This is the final, implementable framework!** The guider's logic perfectly resolves all our conflicts. Ready to code this VIP-first execution system?
