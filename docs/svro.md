on tradelion podcast he mainly talked about continuation i think ... 
and there is talked about SVRO so does SVRO applies to revresals too?
well SVRO requires gap up though .. 
but in 2022 bootcamp he said that he buys just after gapdown cuse that's the enough confirmation there..

Based on Manas Arora's public discussions, including his TraderLion conference talk in July 2025 (which seems to match your "Tradelion podcast" reference—likely a typo or shorthand for TraderLion, as no exact "Tradelion" podcast appears in searches but TraderLion features him prominently on SVRO), he did emphasize continuation trades there. The session focused on his "trading before the breakout" playbook for Indian growth stocks, highlighting risk management and setups like SVRO for capturing momentum in uptrending stocks after pullbacks. This aligns with continuations rather than pure reversals, using case studies of stocks showing relative strength and volatility contraction before upside bursts.

### What is SVRO?
SVRO is a proprietary entry setup coined by Manas Arora, standing for **Strong Start, Value Area, Relative Volume, and Opening Range Break**. It's inspired by Mark Minervini's Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) but refined for his style, focusing on small/mid-cap growth stocks in uptrends. Key elements:
- **Strong Start**: A gap up (or strong open) with immediate buying pressure, often in the first 3-15 minutes. This indicates institutional interest and momentum resumption.
- **Value Area**: Price action around a "value" zone, like near a moving average (e.g., 20/50 EMA) or support after a tight pullback/consolidation (volatility <2-3% range).
- **Relative Volume**: High volume relative to recent averages (e.g., 1.5x+ in early session), confirming conviction—red volume shrinking, green expanding.
- **Opening Range Break**: Break above the opening range high (first 3-15 min bar) as the entry trigger, often on lower timeframes like 3-min or 15-min.

It's designed for high-probability buys in stocks with momentum after orderly pullbacks (e.g., inside bars, base-on-base), aiming to enter before the full breakout for asymmetric risk-reward (e.g., 2% stop, 10-20%+ targets). He stresses it's not about predicting tops/bottoms but reading behavior for "easy money" in trending environments.

### Does SVRO Apply to Reversals?
No, SVRO is primarily for **continuations** in uptrending stocks showing relative strength (e.g., near 52-week highs, up 30-100%+ from lows), not reversals. It requires a bullish "strong start" (often gap up), which contradicts reversal setups where you'd see downside exhaustion. From his X posts and talks, he uses SVRO for trades like #RHIM or #SOUTHBANK, where the stock is already in an uptrend, pulls back tightly, then gaps up with volume for continuation. He hasn't publicly applied it to reversals—it's more a "momentum burst" tool post-contraction.

That said, your point about the 2022 bootcamp is spot on: For **mean reversion/reversals**, he advocates buying after a gap down as "enough confirmation" of stretch/exhaustion (the "rubber band" snapping back), especially in oversold stocks down 15%+ over 3-8 days. This ties into his OOPS reversal (gap down then quick cross above prior close), which is separate from SVRO. SVRO's gap up requirement makes it incompatible with reversal gap downs—it's for bullish resumption, not bottom-fishing.

If your bot is for reversals, stick to the bootcamp logic (gap down + big red bar → breakout). SVRO could complement for continuations in your scanner, but they're distinct. If he evolves it (e.g., a bearish version), nothing recent shows that.
