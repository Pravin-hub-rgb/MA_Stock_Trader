## Q1: In Range contraction, is there any guide with respect to minimum number of candles/days?

**Answer:**

**Minimum Candles for Range Contraction:**
- **Absolute Minimum:** At least 2 candles/days to form a recognizable range
- **One-Day Range:** While technically possible, a single day doesn't provide enough confirmation
- **Two-Day Range:** This is the minimum for a proper range contraction setup
- **Flexibility:** I have taken one-day narrow ranges when the setup is valid with proper strong start

**Key Points:**
- You need at least two candles to call something a "range"
- A two-day range is the standard minimum for range contraction
- One-day narrow range behavior can be considered if the setup is valid
- The key is having a proper range with a strong start confirmation

## Q1b: Generally, how many bars/candles should we have on left side of chart to have a holistic view? e.g., 100 bars or 120 bars?

**Answer:**

**Chart Timeframe for Holistic View:**
- **Minimum Requirement:** Last 3 months of data is sufficient
- **Practical Approach:** Since we're in May, last 3 months of performance provides adequate context
- **New Traders:** May need more historical data (like 100-120 bars) to train their eyes
- **Experienced Traders:** Can work with shorter timeframes as they recognize patterns faster

**Key Considerations:**
- Most range formations become visible within 3 months
- New traders benefit from longer historical context to identify patterns
- As you gain experience, you'll recognize setups with less historical data
- The 3-month window typically captures enough market behavior for analysis

---

## Q1c: In case of reversals trade, what is the minimum SL we should follow? Is 4% at this stage or less say 1% or 2% etc?

**Answer:**

**Stop Loss for Reversal Trades:**
- **Recommended SL:** 4% stop loss for reversal setups
- **Reasoning:** Prevents being stopped out too frequently during the learning phase
- **Consistency:** Same 4% SL applies to both continuation and reversal trades
- **Psychological Factor:** Larger stop helps maintain confidence and reduces constant losses

**Key Principles:**
- 4% stop loss reduces frequency of being stopped out
- Builds confidence during the learning phase
- Maintains consistency across different trade types
- Focus on staying in the game rather than minimizing every small loss

---

## Q1d: How do you do pyramiding? Is it something you do for reversal setups also?

**Answer:**

**Pyramiding Strategy:**
- **Not Practiced:** I don't use pyramiding in my trading approach
- **Single Entry:** I prefer taking full position size on the initial entry
- **Reversal Application:** Since I don't pyramid, this doesn't apply to reversal setups either
- **Simplicity:** Keeping the approach simple with single entries reduces complexity

**Key Points:**
- No progressive position building in my trading methodology
- Single, well-defined entry with full position size
- Applies to both continuation and reversal trades
- Focus on clean, simple execution rather than complex position management

---

## Q1e: What is the weightage you give to volume for deciding about entry or exit? Is there any condition/guideline with respect to volume for entry/exit? If yes, then please tell how you use volume for entry and exit.

**Answer:**

**Volume Analysis and Guidelines:**

**Minimum Volume Requirements:**
- **Account Size Dependent:** Volume thresholds depend on your account size and position sizing
- **Liquidity Rule:** Minimum average volume should be at least 50 times your desired quantity
- **Value Threshold:** Minimum average value volume (avg volume × price) should be around 10 crores
- **Slippage Management:** If experiencing frequent slippage, double your minimum volume threshold

**Volume for Entry/Exit Decisions:**
- **Entry:** Volume is primarily used for stock selection and liquidity assessment
- **Exit:** Volume does NOT determine exits - price action is the primary factor
- **High Volume Days:** Even if a stock closes on low volume, if it hits your target, you exit
- **Profit Taking:** Volume doesn't change the fact that you have no profit margin if price doesn't move in your favor

**Key Principles:**
- Volume is a function of account size and liquidity needs
- Price action, not volume, determines exit decisions
- High volume doesn't justify holding losing positions
- Focus on liquidity requirements rather than volume-based entry/exit rules

---

## Q1f: In reversal setup, what do we prefer - gap down, gap down with some kind of climax, gap up, or strong start?

**Answer:**

**Preferred Reversal Setup Characteristics:**

**Priority Ranking:**
1. **Gap Down with Climax Bar** (Highest Priority)
2. **Gap Down without Climax**
3. **Strong Start**
4. **Gap Up** (Least Preferred)

**Detailed Preferences:**
- **Gap Down with Climax:** This is the ideal reversal setup - shows exhaustion and potential reversal
- **Gap Down:** Good setup showing weakness that could reverse
- **Strong Start:** Acceptable but less reliable than gap down scenarios
- **Gap Up:** Least preferred as it shows continued strength rather than weakness

**Examples:**
- **Paytm Example:** Gap down with climax bar showed the highest reliability
- **Vedanta:** Worked despite not being a gap down climax, showing exceptions exist
- **Practical Application:** If choosing between gap down climax and strong start, always choose the climax

**Key Insight:**
Gap down scenarios, especially with climax bars, indicate selling exhaustion and higher probability of reversal compared to gap up or simple strong start setups.

## Q1g: How much importance do you give to 20MA in general in your continuation setups? Is prior upsloping 20MA a must in these setups even in today's condition when 20MA is kind of choppy in many stocks?

**Answer:**

**20MA Importance in Continuation Setups:**

**Critical Importance:**
- **Major Indicator:** 20MA is very important for continuation setups
- **Market Signal:** Choppy 20MA indicates the market is not favorable for continuation trades
- **Strategy Adjustment:** When 20MA is choppy, it signals to stay out or reduce trading activity
- **Trend Confirmation:** Prior upsloping 20MA is preferred but not absolutely mandatory

**Market Context:**
- **Choppy MA:** When 20MA is choppy, it indicates many stocks are below it
- **Continuation Failure:** Choppy conditions suggest continuation setups are not working
- **Risk Management:** The moving average itself is telling you to stay low or stay out
- **Adaptation:** Adjust your trading approach based on the overall market condition indicated by 20MA

**Key Principle:**
The 20MA serves as a market health indicator - when it's choppy, it's a signal to be more selective or stay out of continuation trades entirely.

---

## Q1h: In continuation setup, do you trade just based on price with range of 5% from 20 days high or do you further select from such stocks based on 1 month and 3 months positive performance?

**Answer:**

**Stock Selection for Continuation Setups:**

**Multi-Scan Approach:**
- **Multiple Scans:** I use different scans and combine results from various sources
- **Scan Sources:** Monthly scan, 3-month scan, and 5% from 20-day high scan
- **Flexible Selection:** If a stock appears in any of these scans, I can select it
- **No Single Filter:** Don't rely on just one selection criteria

**Selection Process:**
- **Scan Combination:** Names can come from monthly performance, 3-month performance, or proximity to 20-day highs
- **Cross-Validation:** A stock appearing in multiple scans gets higher priority
- **Inclusive Approach:** Any stock meeting criteria from any scan is eligible for selection
- **Diversification:** Using multiple scans increases the pool of potential opportunities

**Key Strategy:**
Use a combination of different performance timeframes and technical criteria rather than relying on a single selection method.

---

## Q1i: In continuation setup, range contraction you prefer to happen above 20MA or even below RC is okay?

**Answer:**

**Range Contraction Position Relative to 20MA:**

**Clear Preference:**
- **Above 20MA:** Range contraction should happen above the 20-day moving average
- **Strength Indicator:** Being above 20MA shows the stock has sufficient strength
- **Below 20MA:** Not preferred as it indicates lack of strength and momentum

**Rationale:**
- **Above MA:** Indicates the stock is in an uptrend and has shown strength
- **Below MA:** Suggests the stock lacks the necessary momentum for continuation
- **Quality Selection:** Only stocks showing strength above key moving averages should be considered

**Key Principle:**
Range contraction below the 20MA indicates weakness and is not suitable for continuation setups. Always prefer stocks that maintain strength above key moving averages.

---

## Q1j: In reversal setup, what do you prefer - 30% down in a month or 15% down in last 3-5 days?

**Answer:**

**Preferred Reversal Setup Characteristics:**

**Velocity and Timing:**
- **Fast Moves Preferred:** 15% down in 3-5 days is better than 30% down over a month
- **Climactic Action:** Fast, sharp declines indicate more climactic and potentially more reliable reversals
- **Extended Declines:** Slow, gradual declines (30% over a month) are less attractive
- **Stretch Assessment:** Fast declines look more "stretched" and ready for reversal

**Example Analysis:**
- **Tesla Example:** Fast, climactic decline was more attractive than slow, gradual decline
- **Nestle Trade:** Demonstrated the effectiveness of fast, sharp reversals
- **Preference Hierarchy:** Fast declines > Slow declines for reversal setups

**Key Insight:**
Fast, sharp declines (like 15% in 3-5 days) are more likely to represent genuine selling exhaustion and provide better reversal opportunities compared to slow, grinding declines.

---

## Q1k: When market breadth has moved from extreme level and is at some midway, then what do you prefer to choose - continuation setups or reversal setups?

**Answer:**

**Market Breadth and Setup Selection:**

**Extreme Conditions:**
- **Oversold Markets:** When market breadth shows extreme oversold conditions, prefer reversal setups
- **Overbought Markets:** When market breadth shows extreme overbought conditions, prefer continuation setups

**Midway Conditions:**
- **Neutral Territory:** When market breadth is at midway levels, don't base decisions solely on breadth
- **Setup-Driven:** Focus on individual setup quality rather than market breadth readings
- **Both Valid:** Both continuation and reversal setups can work in neutral market conditions

**Practical Application:**
- **Clear Signals:** Market breadth is most useful at extreme levels to guide setup selection
- **Intermediate Levels:** At midway points, rely more on technical setup quality
- **Example:** On May 11th and 12th, both reversal and continuation setups worked successfully
- **Flexibility:** Don't force a choice between setup types when market conditions are neutral

**Key Strategy:**
Use market breadth primarily as a filter at extreme levels. In neutral conditions, focus on the quality of individual setups rather than trying to choose between continuation or reversal approaches.

---

## Q2: If you use a stoploss limit order, how often does it happen that stock trades below your limit price even after getting triggered and how do you handle it?

**Answer:**

**Stop Loss Limit Order Management:**

**Frequency of Issues:**
- **Occasional Occurrence:** This happens occasionally but I don't have exact statistics
- **Market Conditions:** More common during high volatility or low liquidity periods
- **Stock Specific:** Depends on the individual stock's trading characteristics

**Handling Approach:**
- **Accept Limitations:** Understand that stop loss limit orders have inherent limitations
- **Alternative Orders:** Consider using market orders for critical stop losses when liquidity is a concern
- **Position Sizing:** Use appropriate position sizing to manage potential slippage impact
- **Risk Management:** Factor in potential slippage when determining overall risk per trade

**Key Considerations:**
- Stop loss limit orders provide price protection but may not always execute
- Balance between price protection and execution certainty
- Adjust order types based on stock liquidity and market conditions

---

## Q3: Where do you put alerts because TradingView allows only 1 alert? Do we have another free alternative for it?

**Answer:**

**Alert Management Solutions:**

**TradingView Alerts:**
- **Primary Platform:** I use TradingView for my main alerts
- **Multiple Alerts:** TradingView actually allows more than one alert (typically 30-40 alerts)
- **Organization:** Use different alert types for different purposes

**Alternative Free Solutions:**
- **Broker Platforms:** Most discount brokers offer free alert services
- **Online Brokers:** Many online trading platforms provide alert functionality
- **Mobile Apps:** Various trading apps offer free alert features

**Practical Approach:**
- **Multiple Sources:** Use a combination of TradingView and broker alerts
- **Priority Alerts:** Reserve TradingView for high-priority setups
- **Backup Alerts:** Use broker alerts as backup for important levels

**Key Strategy:**
Don't rely on a single alert system. Use multiple platforms to ensure you don't miss important trading opportunities.

## Q4: Why didn't you buy previous boxes breakout in the BSE 100 trade?

**Answer:**

**Trade Selection and Prioritization:**

**Multiple Trade Considerations:**
- **Time Constraints:** On that particular day, I was already occupied with other trades
- **Priority Selection:** I prioritize trades that offer the clearest setups in the first 10 minutes
- **Limited Capacity:** I can only manage a limited number of positions at once

**Decision Factors:**
- **Setup Quality:** The BSE 100 breakout may not have been as clean as other opportunities
- **Timing:** I focus on getting the best setups early in the day
- **Risk Management:** Taking too many trades can dilute focus and increase risk

**Key Principle:**
You cannot take every good setup. Focus on the highest quality opportunities and avoid over-trading.

**Position Management During Volatility:**

**Advanced Risk Management:**
- **Rule-Based Approach:** This involves advanced position management techniques
- **Experience Required:** Such decisions require significant trading experience
- **Context Dependent:** Management depends on the specific market context and setup

**General Principles:**
- **Stop Loss Adherence:** Maintain discipline with predetermined stop levels
- **Position Sizing:** Use appropriate position sizing to handle volatility
- **Market Context:** Consider overall market conditions when managing positions

**Key Insight:**
Position management during volatile periods is an advanced skill that develops with experience. Focus on mastering basic risk management first.

---

## Q6: When do you use 2H or other hourly charts?

**Answer:**

**Chart Timeframe Selection:**

**Primary Focus:**
- **Daily Charts:** My priority is daily charts for setup identification
- **Intraday Charts:** Use intraday charts only to understand specific entry points
- **Timeframe Flexibility:** I don't restrict myself to specific timeframes

**Practical Application:**
- **4-Hour Charts:** Very similar to daily charts (2 candles = 1 day)
- **Lower Timeframes:** 15-minute, 30-minute charts can show noise and confusion
- **Decision Making:** Higher timeframes provide clearer trend direction

**Key Strategy:**
Use multiple timeframes but prioritize daily charts for setup identification. Lower timeframes should support, not contradict, the daily chart analysis.

---

## Q7: Do you use ATR, if yes, then how?

**Answer:**

**ATR Usage in Trading:**

**Current Practice:**
- **Not Currently Used:** I don't actively use ATR in my current trading approach
- **Historical Context:** I explained ATR usage in my third class
- **Alternative Methods:** I rely on other methods for position sizing and risk management

**ATR Applications (General):**
- **Position Sizing:** ATR can help determine appropriate position sizes
- **Stop Loss Placement:** Can be used to set dynamic stop losses
- **Volatility Assessment:** Helps gauge stock volatility for trade selection

**Key Insight:**
While ATR is a useful tool, it's not essential for my current trading methodology. Focus on mastering the core concepts first.

## Q8: During the SS in reversal or continuation trade, if you have two options with almost the same quality of SS (strong start), and one is up by 5% and another is up by 2%, which one would you go for and why? If you go with 2% gap up, then you're not going with the one which has good buying force, and if you go with 5%, then you have already lost a good part of the move.

**Answer:**

**Trade Selection Between Similar Setups:**

**Decision Framework:**
- **No Universal Answer:** Both options have advantages and disadvantages
- **Rule-Based Approach:** Establish clear rules for such scenarios
- **Consistency:** Whatever method you choose, apply it consistently

**Option Analysis:**

**5% Gap Up:**
- **Advantage:** Confirms strong trend and buying force
- **Disadvantage:** Reduced risk-reward ratio, entering later in move
- **Consideration:** May still have significant upside potential

**2% Gap Up:**
- **Advantage:** Better entry price, improved risk-reward ratio
- **Disadvantage:** Less confirmation of strength
- **Consideration:** May not have the same momentum

**Key Principles:**
- **Rule Development:** Create specific rules for such scenarios
- **Risk Management:** Consider position sizing based on entry quality
- **Trade Management:** Adjust targets and stops based on entry timing

**Practical Approach:**
Develop a consistent method for choosing between similar setups and stick to it regardless of individual trade outcomes.

## Q9: Do we re-enter in continuation trade in intraday, if yes, then how? Please show a few examples if possible.

**Answer:**

**Intraday Re-entry Strategy:**

**General Approach:**
- **Not Recommended for Beginners:** Intraday re-entry requires significant screen time and experience
- **Focus on Basics:** New traders should focus on initial entries rather than re-entries
- **Advanced Technique:** This is an advanced trading skill

**Re-entry Considerations:**
- **Screen Time:** Requires active monitoring throughout the day
- **Experience Level:** Only attempt after mastering basic entry techniques
- **Risk Management:** Proper position sizing and stop loss management essential

**Key Strategy:**
For now, focus on getting the initial entry right. Don't worry about intraday re-entries until you have mastered the basics and have sufficient screen time.

**Journal Components:**
- **Basic Information:** Date, stock, entry/exit prices, P&L
- **Setup Details:** Type of setup, reasoning for the trade
- **Emotional Notes:** Feelings and thoughts during the trade
- **Lessons Learned:** Key takeaways from each trade

**Key Principle:**
Keep the journal simple and focused on actionable insights. The goal is to learn from each trade, not to create a complex record-keeping system.

---

## Q12: Stocks with strong buying force get good follow-through for a few days in case of reversal, but a reversal in a weak stock generally doesn't last long. Is my observation correct?

**Answer:**

**Reversal Quality Assessment:**

**Observation Analysis:**
- **Not Necessarily True:** Strong stocks can reverse just like weak stocks
- **Market Context:** Entire markets can reverse together, making weak stocks strong
- **Example:** Maruti reversed 20% despite being down significantly

**Key Insights:**
- **Avoid Biases:** Don't create biases about which stocks can reverse
- **Let Trade Decide:** Allow the trade itself to show its strength
- **Market Conditions:** Consider overall market context when assessing reversals

**Practical Approach:**
Focus on the setup quality rather than preconceived notions about stock strength. Let the price action tell you whether the reversal has staying power.

---

## Q13: Do we have any way to capture reversal moves in stocks which give almost slightly weak start, neither they get oversold in small TF nor they form any kind of range, they just suddenly blast, like DMart?

**Answer:**

**Capturing Sudden Reversal Moves:**

**Current Focus:**
- **Stick to Basics:** Don't try to capture every type of move initially
- **Strong Start Priority:** Focus on the strong start methodology

**Key Message:**
Focus on mastering the techniques I've already taught. Don't try to learn everything at once. The basic methods provide enough trading opportunities.

---

## Q14: If you have SS and gap down both at the same time, so what would you prefer to trade? Gap down makes the overall setup sweeter and SS shows strength at that particular time.

**Answer:**

**Gap Down vs Strong Start Priority:**

**Clear Preference:**
- **Gap Down with Climax:** This is the highest priority setup
- **Gap Down Advantage:** Shows exhaustion and potential reversal
- **Liquidity Consideration:** Prefer liquid stocks for gap down setups

**Practical Application:**
- **Gap Down Priority:** If choosing between gap down climax and strong start, always choose the gap down
- **Size Consideration:** Gap down setups allow for larger position sizes in liquid stocks
- **Success Rate:** Gap down scenarios historically provide better risk-reward profiles

**Key Insight:**
Gap down with climax bars indicate selling exhaustion and offer superior reversal opportunities compared to simple strong starts.

---

## Q15: If we have a gap down and low is equal to open, so will we consider that as a strong start? If not, then can I conclude that gap up is important to buy a continuation setup and if we get a gap up plus open and low same, then it's better, otherwise open low same has no relevance when alone.

**Answer:**

**Gap Down and Open/Low Analysis:**

**Gap Down Considerations:**
- **Gap Down Alone:** Gap down with low equal to open can be a valid setup
- **Gap Up Preference:** Gap up is generally preferred for continuation setups
- **Open/Low Same:** This pattern has value when combined with other factors

**Setup Quality:**
- **Gap Up + Open/Low Same:** This is the ideal combination
- **Open/Low Same Alone:** Has limited value without other confirming factors
- **Context Matters:** Consider the overall setup quality and market context

**Key Principle:**
While gap up is preferred, gap down scenarios can still provide valid trading opportunities, especially in reversal setups.

---

## Q16: Please discuss a few examples where you have bought same day high or the previous day high, so we can have some clarity on that part. Please ignore if we don't do that.

**Answer:**

**Same Day High and Previous Day High Trading:**

**General Approach:**
- **Not Recommended:** I generally avoid buying at same day highs or previous day highs
- **Risk Assessment:** These levels often represent resistance and increased risk
- **Better Alternatives:** Focus on setups with better risk-reward profiles

**Trading Philosophy:**
- **Patience:** Wait for better entry opportunities
- **Risk Management:** Avoid chasing stocks at new highs
- **Setup Quality:** Prioritize setups with clear support levels

**Key Message:**
Focus on the trading methods I've already taught rather than seeking exceptions to the rules.

## Q18: In the case of continuation trades, I have observed that you prefer to buy stocks above 20MA. Is my observation correct? I have observed a similar kind of pattern in the slides which you have shared, you haven't mentioned any stock below 20MA. If the observation is correct, then do you only give priority to above 20MA stocks or do you entirely avoid stocks below 20MA?

**Answer:**

**20MA Preference in Continuation Setups:**

**Observation Confirmation:**
- **Correct Observation:** Yes, I do prefer stocks above 20MA for continuation setups
- **Strength Indicator:** Stocks above 20MA show better momentum and strength
- **Quality Selection:** This helps filter for higher quality continuation opportunities

**Practical Application:**
- **Above 20MA Priority:** Give preference to stocks trading above their 20-day moving average
- **Below 20MA Avoidance:** Generally avoid continuation setups in stocks below 20MA
- **Trend Alignment:** Being above 20MA indicates the stock is in an uptrend

**Key Principle:**
Trading with the trend (above 20MA) increases the probability of successful continuation setups.

---

## Q19: Don't you think we should have avoided the stock which is provided as an example of continuation setup in slides page no 20 as it already up multiple days in a row, it has got 6 green candles out of 8 candles.

**Answer:**

**Extended Move Assessment:**

**Setup Evaluation:**
- **Not Necessarily Overextended:** Six green candles out of eight doesn't automatically mean overextended
- **Context Dependent:** Need to consider the overall move size and consolidation
- **Setup Quality:** The specific setup characteristics matter more than candle count

**Key Considerations:**
- **Move Size:** Look at the actual percentage move, not just candle count
- **Consolidation:** Check if there was adequate rest between moves
- **Breakout Quality:** Assess the quality of the breakout from consolidation

**Key Insight:**
Don't automatically avoid stocks with multiple green candles. Evaluate each setup on its individual merits and overall context.

---

## Q20: Continuation setup slides page no 25, could you please explain that trade because there was no tightness before you entered into it (please go on lower TF as well to explain a bit in detail if possible).

**Answer:**

**Tightness Analysis in Continuation Setups:**

**Trade Explanation:**
- **Second Day Entry:** This was a second-day entry rather than first-day
- **Consolidation Pattern:** The setup showed adequate consolidation for the entry
- **Timeframe Consideration:** Lower timeframes may show different patterns than daily charts

**Key Points:**
- **Entry Timing:** Second-day entries can be valid continuation setups
- **Consolidation Quality:** Look for adequate rest and consolidation
- **Multiple Timeframes:** Consider how different timeframes show the setup

**Learning Approach:**
- **Study the Pattern:** Analyze the specific price action that made this a valid setup
- **Apply Principles:** Use similar analysis for future continuation opportunities
- **Flexibility:** Understand that setups can vary in their characteristics

**Key Insight:**
Not all continuation setups will show perfect tightness. Focus on the overall setup quality and context.

---

## Q21: There was an indicator of Rvol on the right side of your chart. Could you explain a bit about relative volume as well, which indicator we use and how we use it?

**Answer:**

**Relative Volume Analysis:**

**Indicator Purpose:**
- **Volume Assessment:** Relative volume shows current volume compared to average
- **Breakout Confirmation:** Helps confirm the strength of breakouts and moves
- **Early Signal:** Can provide early indication of strong trading days

**Usage in Trading:**
- **First 10 Minutes:** Check relative volume in the first 10 minutes of trading
- **Breakout Validation:** High relative volume confirms breakout strength
- **Volume Analysis:** If 20% of daily volume comes in first 10 minutes, expect high volume day

**Practical Application:**
- **Priority Setting:** Use relative volume to prioritize between similar setups
- **Confirmation Tool:** High relative volume adds confidence to trade entries
- **Not Essential:** Can trade successfully without relative volume, but it's helpful

**Key Insight:**
Relative volume is a useful confirmation tool but not essential for successful trading. Focus on mastering the basics first.

## Q24: Do we check free float? If yes, then please give some commentary on that? I know how to check and what free float is, please elaborate on how do we use it in our trading?

**Answer:**

**Free Float in Trading:**

**Usage in Strategy:**
- **Liquidity Assessment:** Free float helps assess stock liquidity for position sizing
- **Slippage Management:** Higher free float generally means lower slippage
- **Position Size:** Use free float to determine appropriate position sizes

**Practical Application:**
- **Volume Thresholds:** Ensure adequate free float relative to your position size
- **Liquidity Requirements:** Higher account sizes need higher free float stocks
- **Risk Management:** Consider free float when assessing potential slippage

**Key Principle:**
Free float is primarily a liquidity and risk management tool rather than a setup selection criterion.

---
