Anyways, Let's move one wedge. 

Said other. 

Start with this. 

The first Thing that I trade the majorities trades and tapes, and you can go and verify it on on my account. 

On Twitter, the majority trades have taken are part of these continuation modes, so I showed you yesterday. 

What is the continuation move? 

So, if this stock is an uptrend Internet, There is some Prophet booking. 

It goes down For this Goes And crosses this previous High. 

Simply put, it's a continuation move. 



18:00
Trend is continuing in the same direction where it was before going into this correct. 

Is this clear? 

Is this clear here? 

I have selected. 

Some 26 lights majority which are on available on Twitter. 

Come may not be, maybe I never posted them whatever but the at least 70 to 80% are there on on my account and I will show you that. 

Why I got them wire selected that stock. 

What am I looking? 

Why this set of works and first of all, I would, I'll explain why this set of so 

So what I do is I have added this 20 moving average line. 

Why? 

Because it this average moving average line, 20, moving. 

As a simply means for those people who have no idea about this line, 20 average, moving average means it is the average of last 20 days. 

Closing price, simple moving average. 

I'm not getting into, you should use ema or wma or sma all these things. 

Like I said, yesterday things don't play a major role. 

You make a lot of money on Emma will make less money on SMS my Idea. 

You are free to use 20 Emma. 

Is that clear? 

Is that clear? 

Allight. 

So Banaya, this average 

What does this line indicate this rising 20 ml line indicate? 

The stock is not definite up Trend. 

If I, if this is today, 10th November 21st today if I feel past the stock is definitely in a strong uptrend and as of now on 10th November, if this is today, if I ask you, is this young move or old move 

It's not an old move. 

It's a definitely a young move, it. 

It went up corrected, a lot and it still here. 

It is not this. 

This is a I will say that this is the not. 

Yes, if I remove this line, like, see this, Yes, if I remove this line, like see this, if you compare from your, it's very, very stressed. 

The angle is if you I mean if you your eyes are not trained obviously your new person you can use the trend angle and see it yourself. 

This is clearly or next standard and especially in the last two days. 

So here this is extended then. 

So here this is extended. 

Then then it depend into correction price goes down below this line line. 

Also, the slope of the line also is now downward and then it gathered somebesh and started going up. 

Now we are here. 

And then again it went down. 

This is 10th November. 

Now, this is 10. 

Mm box. 

So if this is not an old, this is definitely not in old more, some of you will be confused. 

But if you practice, when I said you go to lot of name, you will get better at spotting young and old for daily Maye. 

Not today. 

But you will everyone who has put an effort from one also boot camp one. 

They can vouch for it. 

They are much better than what they were. 

When they started to whatever you're going through, is not a unique problem. 

It happens with everyone. 

But if you put in the effort of going through, thousands of a charge along in, like, in coming days, you will also reach a level where you can confidently say that this is young or not. 

So why? 

So why and explaining while this set of work? 

So, this talk here, 

Is up some 20% from in only four days. 

If I start from this lowest point, this is 30%, or if I start from here, it's 44% by. 

All means 44% in 35 days, 30% and 16 days manufacturing. 

The latest one, which is the latest breakout 20% in 4 days. 

So my all means if, if I am, if if I don't use the line also I can definitely say that there is a buying force. 

There is a buying force, right? 

So, there are BIOS in the stock, which are taking, which took the stock up from 417 2493, then cellulose at this level.

Vin.AI, [29-12-2025 18:29]
And this level all the buying stop saloj over power. 

MD started bringing the price town and a manage to got it down below this line also. 

So, Can I now say that? 

Can I now say that lot of weak hands? 

When I say we can, we can mean people who are buying with a very, very short to target. 

All people who are buying with on margin money or in another word loan month on loan email, or buying will just for two or three days thinking that they can make quick gain, but they just got, like, especially people who enter like buy on based on tips, especially after it's already three to four days up in a row like I should yesterday. 

These guys are quart at the Wrong Turn, because it bored right at the top there. 

Ignore that you do because they don't know. 

Not that ignored. 

They don't know this concept of three days in a row code, is in a row, and they got here in this week. 

So these guys are cot and now the stock is not going out further, it's coming down. 

So at some point this guy was about it here on loan. 

Money will be first to liquidate, right? 

Who got here, quantity. 

Who got here? 

Quantity. 

Now they are selling because they don't have the money they have. 

Now, the stock is coming down. 

They stop, got hit, whatever reason, and just saying the week hands are getting out. 

And then at this point, whatever selling was happening, it stopped buyers. 

Extin again. 

There is no one is There is no. 

If sellers are more than buyer, the trial will come down. 

If sellers are more than buyer, the trial will come down here. 

The selling stopped because bias overpowered and the stock started going up. 

So if you read this prine goes below, rising 20 MH which is called range expansion. 

Can I call it? 

Can I call it? 

Is this? 

The whole fall as world high volatility, right? 

So like show yesterday, they are only two things. 

Either is R or RC, there is no third thing. 

Then price comes back. 

Ask. 

And then goes sideways, which is range contraction. 

And then next day, one word started going up. 

If you see the fall, this time itself, 13 around 14% around. 

15% in the next. 

So in this contraction, invitelity the selling has dried a lot like here sellers could manage. 

So in this contraction invitelity the selling has dried a lot like here sellers could manage to drop the price by 15% here. 

They could only drop to 3%. 

It's like a towel which is like wets. 

Right? 

At some stage. 

There are Right, at some stage. 

There are no, what there is no water level because it's completely dried. 

But it's almost right, right before you put it for drawing in the sun. 

You, we hands are out. 

Yes, so But it's almost right, right? 

Before you put it for drawing in the sun. 

You, we hands are out. 

Yes. 

So here lot of we hands are out to it. 

It is down, 15% because lot of cell, we hands were present friends, but when the price came up here, but this time, in this fall, there are not many leak hands, present, because it's everywhere. 

And because the stock never cracks more than 3% and yesterday. 

Someone ask me, how do you spot or range? 

You been doing AR and RC in the past, but how to spot in the current when like today. 

So if I if you use zoom in too much like this, maybe you are not ready to spot it, but I can clearly see that this is a, I am a train person. 

I have experience so I can clearly spot that this is a contraction is this a valid drawing But if you cannot But if you cannot right now, of course, some of you majority of you will not be able to spotted if you zoom like this. 

Now, you see your range here? 

Do you see this? 

This is the range here. 

And on right on top of it, boxson box, besan base. 

Another range. 

Are you able to spot it easily? 

I mean easier. 

So that's how you spot in the current if you if you want to unable to spot it like this then try and compressed using the the scroll of your mouth and see if you it helps you. 

I don't need it because I mean, clearly it there is a 

Aur u formation prize goes down below. 

20mm comes back up.

Vin.AI, [29-12-2025 18:29]
I'll draw it again. 

Pray goes down. 

Goes below. 

20. 

Welcome back off. 

Then goes sideways. 

This is typical Another word. 

If you draw rate there is a this is a clear range of four days. 

If you draw rate, there is a, this is a clear range of four days. 

This is a base on base, on base form and formation which is why So anyway I'm not the queries are for later, but yeah. 

So anyway I'm not the queries are for later. 

But yeah, if you have a query, write it down, write it down and say it for telegram, or say wait for the qaa session. 

If you want to know why did not by BSE years and write it down and save this question, where you executed? 

I am just saying, please write your question. 

This class is not please read this one more time. 

This class is about this. 

I am not covering where to tell today's so where you exited just remember the agenda if you ask me anything outside this. 

I am not covering where to tell today's so where you exited just remember the agenda. 

If you ask me anything outside this, then you are wasting your time. 

So yeah this is the set up and white works so price goes below 20 which is rent expansion. 

Came back up went sideways for two days. 

I have drawn it also, and then exploded the next day onward and went up for four days. 

Did it follow? 

Did it follow the foundation? 

Discuss yesterday or no. 

All the way up. 

It followed the foundation that we discussed yesterday. 

It's not defined anything that we discussed yesterday. 

Alright next is this empty AR Technologies? 

Yes, this one is is the stock and definite uptrend. 

Then rising 20 stock go Then rising 20 stock goes below that line, which means rain expansion comes backup. 

Then for two days, give you narrow range formation. 

Very, very small. 

These are big days. 

Also don't get lost in numbers of point. 

Also don't get lost in numbers of point4.6.7 is this similar to it's not entirely identical to BSc but is this similar to the same BSc formation and then for two days it settle right on the 20 ml you don't narrow range? 

Come relatively narrow range compared to what it was doing from 20 days 20 days back. 

It was going up 5% 6% here. 

Also 4%, comparatively, it is now down to small formation and then the next day it gave a Ek broke out and this is how it moved and please tell me. 

Did it define the Foundation? 



18:19
Bhi discuss yesterday. 

Is moving in the same manner. 

It's moving in the same manner. 

Four days in a row and then there was a profit booking on fifth day. 

It was 40 was 44% of it. 

This was one of the cases where you got a exceptional move average and then it had to settle down. 

On the fifth day, there is a good 5%, approximately 5% fall and then this is it did not do mass for many, many days after that. 

So this setup is basically, you have Agar. 

When you, you need to spot a rising 20 MMA where When you, you need to spot a rising 20 MMA, where the price is, was an uptrend. 

If you, you don't need to do this, the rising 20m will tell you. 

The stock is an attract if you not using any moving average. 

I can spot and up trend but you can start with this 20 and moving average line. 

Then a simple, the stock goes below, 20. 

Then a simple. 

The stock goes below. 

20 comes back up and 9 out of 10 times. 

I'll show you that it will settle down one more time, right? 

Around that. 

Like right around that line, it will most and most cases. 

It will give you narrow range formation around that line and that is your entry point. 

There is a clear up Trend. 

There is a clear up Trend stock goes down. 

Comes back up for over five days down, right on that line. 

If you can't spotted like this like this, don't do this. 

Then you might see that all the, the size of the bar is came as the size of, but if you do this, 

Is there a clear range forming right on that line? 

And I selected for the next day I put And I selected, for the next day, I put it in my watchlist for the next day and then this is what it did.

Vin.AI, [29-12-2025 18:29]
In one day, just in one day, it give me a move of 15%. 

So this was I explained you that why this set of works, what is the, what is the like concept behind it? 

The concept is very simple. 

There is a uptrend. 

Buyers are strong in the stock. 

There is a buying force buying force. 

In this talk, was 30% in a only 11 bar. 

To clearly there is a buying forward. 

Strong buying force then the same stock goes through. 

Correction this one went almost came. 

Almost down to the previous level, then gathered some strength. 

Then again came down again, gather strength. 

And this time is resting on that. 

20 ml line from five days in a row forward days. 

Sorry, five days. 

Yes, so this is what my area of interest is. 

This is what I select for my, the set of like this. 

If I open only this, this is the This is March, 22, is this and old book. 

This is March 22, is this and old book is it is our old move from my enemy. 

We are doing, we are playing for 10. 

15%, we are not playing for 200 300%. 

Yes, Maye from here. 

It will not do it on percent. 

But I mean, this is a clear cut young move. 

I mean, if it starts breaking out, it will be a young. 

No, and this was never. 

This was also when I started moving, I 

This is clearly not a old mobile enemies. 

Anyway, so Adani enterprise ya. 

Same formation. 

There is a clear up Trend buying forces, 30%, in 16 days. 

30% in 16 days 16 bar because the daily chart then selling happens, I am sure, lot of weekend out. 

Selling means weekends are getting out and why is it important? 

Why the we can getting out of is an important requirement because if you want to buy get into a stock and if it is full of, if you get in here on the on the next slide at here, after so many green weeks in a row, it is you have studied already and you will go through many mains you to the homework. 

You know that the stock is already going up, so many days in a row, it is due for a pause and this is where all the weekends are will get out. 

So when you, when the weekends are out and you buy that stock, and when it starts going up, there will be less people to select to selling desktops, shall be less. 

We can selling the stock. 

So is there is less selling happening. 

The price progression will not stall. 

But if you buy her if you reg Many people many A lot of A lot of, right? 

It have been to you. 

Also answer, it must have been with you, that whenever you buy, right after you buy, rest reversing goes down a lot. 

The number one reason for that is you are ignoring the, you must have, but when the stop is already going up from many days or many weeks, The number one reason for that is you are ignoring the, you must have, but when the stop is already going up from many days or many weeks. 

So, the number one reason why when you, when you get into something and it immediately reverses and goes down a lot, is because you are doing select. 

Your status selection is wrong. 

You buying at the wrong time you buying after you knowing the number of days, is already observe the number of weeks. 

It's already. 

So that is the reason why you start with the loss. 

And you try to buy on the day, one of the move and this And you try to buy on the day, one of the move. 

So I was explaining that there is a uptrend, rising 20 m a So I was explaining that there is a uptrend, rising 20 m, a also confirm that then there is selling. 

Then price goes up. 

Then there is a clear range formation and if you can't supported like this, try the hack again. 

Is it easier to spot this? 

Now. 

If you zoom like this. 

If you zoom like this, maybe you may, you might miss out, but not there is a clear, so five days of rest, right? 

On that line. 

And then when I see this, I select Adani. 

Put it in my watchlist, for the next day. 

Two and down now. 

Two and down. 

Now, this answer, Why this, Why This pattern works on the next thing is, which one, two by you will be when you, when you. 

So how do you find this? 

These name I explained yesterday, you opened, or you run the scans.
