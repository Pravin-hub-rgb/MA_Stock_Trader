# Overview
- Reality Check
    - Joining any bootcamp or any sessions will not turn you into a successfull trader right after the gets over.
    - It is a really really hard skill to get.
    - The way a typical human behaves we need to behave just opposite way to survive in this market and that's a change in human behaviour that does not come right away, it is a painfully long process, it takes month and year depending how much effort you are putting.
    - For the first few month you will fell like you are throwing darts in the air, they are going in every direction but if you collect the data of those darts then you will find out what is working and what is not working because everyone is different the personality is different the patience is different some can go through the losses easily some initially don't like the word loss so it takes time. 
    - Please give yourself one year and on this one year your objective should be to only survive not thrive. 
    - Turnaround comes ones you study all your mistakes. Even just no repeating mistakes adds to your bottom lines.
