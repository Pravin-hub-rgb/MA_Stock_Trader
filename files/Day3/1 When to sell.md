# When to Sell - Trading Rules

## Overview

Knowing when to sell is one of the most challenging aspects of trading. This document outlines systematic rules for exiting positions to maximize profits while managing risk and psychological factors.

## Exit Strategy Categories

### Profit-Taking Rules

#### 50% Position Rule
**When to Sell:** Sell 50% of position at 15% profit or after 3 days (whichever comes first).

**Why This Rule:** This approach provides immediate profits while allowing the remaining position to capture larger moves. It balances profit-taking with letting winners run.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Target: 15% profit for partial exit
- Time limit: 3 days maximum holding period
- Exit 50% position when either condition is met

**Psychological Benefit:** Provides mental relief and reduces stress on remaining position.

#### Cost Protection Rule
**When to Sell:** Move stop-loss to cost price after achieving 3-5% profit.

**Why This Rule:** Eliminates risk on the trade and provides psychological freedom to let remaining position run.

**Implementation:**
- After 3-5% gain, move stop to break-even
- For strong markets: may require only 3% gain
- For weak markets: may require 5% gain

**Mental Freedom:** Removes fear of loss on profitable trades.

#### Selling into Strength Rule
**When to Sell:** Sell when stock is rising, not falling.

**Why This Rule:** Provides better liquidity and execution. When everyone is buying, it's easier to exit large positions at good prices.

**Key Benefits:**
- Better execution prices
- Higher liquidity during up moves
- Easier to exit large positions

**Contrast:** Avoid selling during down moves when liquidity is poor.

### Risk Management Rules

#### Emergency Stop Rule
**When to Sell:** Exit immediately if price breaks below emergency stop level (intrady basis).

**Why This Rule:** Protects against sudden reversals and limits losses. Emergency stops are tighter than trailing stops for immediate protection.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Set emergency stop below key support levels
- Monitor intraday price action
- Exit immediately if emergency stop is breached

**Risk Protection:** Prevents large losses from sudden market moves.

#### Emergency Stop with Waiting Period
**When to Sell:** If price breaks below 20-day moving average, wait 3-4 days before selling to confirm the move.

**Why This Rule:** Stocks often test the 20-day MA line and bounce back. Waiting allows for false breakouts to recover while still protecting against major reversals.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Monitor stock behavior around 20-day MA for 3-4 days
- Look for signs of recovery or continued weakness
- Exit if stock fails to bounce back within 3-4 days
- Many winners test the 20-day MA line before continuing higher

**Confirmation Period:** Allows time to distinguish between false breakouts and genuine trend reversals.

#### Trailing Stop Strategy
**When to Sell:** Use trailing stops based on 20-day moving average for remaining positions.

**Why This Rule:** The 20-day moving average provides dynamic support levels that adapt to price action, allowing profits to run while protecting against major reversals.

**Implementation:**
- Trail stop at 20-day moving average
- Adjust stop level daily based on moving average
- Exit completely when price closes below moving average

**Risk Management:** Prevents giving back significant profits while allowing trends to continue.

### Time-Based Rules

#### Time-Based Exit Rule
**When to Sell:** Exit entire position after 3 days if 15% target not reached.

**Why This Rule:** Prevents holding underperforming positions that drain mental energy and capital. Three days is the average duration for successful moves.

**Key Indicators:**
- Position struggling to reach 15% target
- Price action showing weakness or indecision
- Market conditions changing unfavorably

**Capital Efficiency:** Frees up capital for better opportunities.

#### Screen Time Management Rule
**When to Sell:** Avoid constant screen monitoring after position entry.

**Why This Rule:** Reduces emotional decision-making and prevents premature exits due to normal price fluctuations.

**Implementation:**
- Enter trade and set predetermined exit rules
- Avoid checking price constantly
- Only review position near closing time

**Psychological Benefit:** Reduces stress and improves decision quality.

### Adaptive Rules

#### Market Context Rule
**When to Sell:** Adjust selling strategy based on overall market conditions.

**Why This Rule:** Market environment affects move sustainability. In weak markets, use tighter stops and smaller targets.

**Market Adaptation:**
- Strong markets: wider stops, larger targets
- Weak markets: tighter stops, smaller targets
- Sideways markets: focus on quick profits

**Flexibility:** Adapt rules to current market environment.

#### Reversal-Specific Selling Rules
**When to Sell:** For reversal trades, use 15% target with 3-5 day maximum duration.

**Why This Rule:** Reversals are counter-trend moves that work in shorter timeframes (3-5 days) compared to continuations. They cannot sustain for weeks or months like trend-following moves.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **Target:** 15% profit (same as continuations)
- **Duration:** Maximum 3-5 days (shorter than continuations)
- **Exit Timing:** Exit by 3rd day if target not reached
- **No Moon Trailing:** Don't trail stops to extreme levels for reversals
- **Counter-Trend Nature:** Reversals work against the prevailing trend, limiting their duration

**Time Constraint:** Reversals have shorter lifespans due to their counter-trend nature, requiring quicker exits than continuation moves.

## Implementation Framework

1. **Entry Phase:** Set initial stop-loss and target levels
2. **50% Exit:** Sell half position at 15% or 3 days
3. **Cost Protection:** Move stop to break-even after 3-5% gain

5. **Emergency Exit:** Monitor for sudden reversals
6. **Time Exit:** Exit if 3-day limit reached without target
7. **Strength Selling:** Prefer selling during up moves
8. **Market Adaptation:** Adjust strategy based on market conditions

## Key Principles

- **Rule-Based Approach:** Follow predetermined rules to remove emotion
- **Risk Management:** Always protect capital with proper stops
- **Profit Taking:** Take partial profits to reduce stress

4. **Ignoring Market Context:** Always consider overall market environment
