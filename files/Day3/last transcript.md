Strong node on a very high volume that takes my that gets my priority. 

Now, next time is when to play reversal Over continuation, like, in this week, we saw my was sharing only reversal names, right? 

When the entire market is down three, four, five days in a row, or you have many stocks down into five days, where should the priority bhi and I showed with proof. 

So clearly, They say that stock that goal strong. 

The stocks that are not following a showing the strength. 

I've shown it twice but the next day reversals are going up. 

I've shown it twice, but the next day reversals are going up reversions are is where the money is reversal. 

Is where the money is. 

Continuation, is not moving the next day. 

Like aur Lauda reversions have Like aur Lauda reversions have worked like yesterday versus work. 

I think one day will also be a continuation of the reversal move that started GST day. 

Have already work in that market. 

Have already work in that market, both can work continuation and also worked. 

But the easy way to spot reversal this when the whole market crashing for three to four days in a room and your list is full of reverses, there is one thing I would like to add to the watchlist. 

A few have a choice between buying and extended fall in Reliance or Bajaj Finance or small market cap for something. 

It is less likely to reverse, then extended fall in Reliance extended. 

Probably why Maruti when I Probably why Maruti when I got Maruti and I described it also, it is a large dying. 

It is not a normal for a size like Maruti value. 

Invester ID like me to jumping at this level study it yourself. 

What is the adr or Maruti is close to 3%? 

When I bought it when I wanted to st%. 

So all these assumptions can be rectified will go away if you just study this. 

These names group are not low Idea. 

Yeah. 

Um, because cotton is, there is an Ambika cotton fault. 

I am not going to America. 

Coming back to how to avoid Coming back to how to avoid big bro dance. 

Now this is very more important is like very, very important. 

There will be every one of you, including me. 

There will go through your face square. 

If you do not control your Ye no matter small Bande. 

The small losses will add up and they will turn into a The small losses will add up and they will turn into a big drawdown reserve even realize. 

So how do I control it? 

Like, like I have cell rules. 

I also have drawn rules and because of these rules, if some of you are following me from 2016, 2017, anyone here, following means from then, if you following from there, you must have seen that. 

I'm still here, I have survived. 

All the all those crazy covid and electionity war volatility, demortization and whatever. 

Guidelines should be flexible with these guidelines. 

Let's Guidelines should be flexible with these guidelines. 

Let's say you lose. 

You don't find percent stop for a week or 10 days, why? 

Two reasons, you are down, five% one equal to because of you are wrong, you will been trading wrong setups, which I'm sure with time will get better. 

So, most likely it's not you, it's the market, which is not working, the stocks are not working. 

So, if you stop for a week or 10 days in those 10 is lot of stocks, lot of volatility and just would be settle somewhat. 

What is not working you Like I said, if you remember seller rules, why am I bring in my stop to cost? 

My stop My stop and bringing to post for the mental capital for the mental peace. 

So if I don't have that. 

If I'm done 5% and every day I am going and taking trades, even when things are not working. 

If I am doing really bad, If I am doing really bad, it's it's because because I, my status selection is pretty much. 

Okay, then it's definitely the market and if I don't realize it, if I don't accepted FM, still going for it, then I am just basically going into a rough, right? 

Bumpy road, and I'm drawing. 

I am driving a very, very on a bumpy road, which is even if you, if you try to know what happens. 

So, if I take a break, I can, I am giving market to set. 

I'm giving time to market to settle down and I also getting, I'm giving time to myself to come up. 

Come back to the king slate. 

When I come back, I come back with. 

Let's say, time if I was creating with 10 lakhs, now I trade with 5 lakhs, or if I was trading with.5% risk, now, I'm trading with.25%, is market, is if you lose even at this level then you probably take may be because we are in a very, very mad market scenario. 

The whole market is also bad. 

That even 10 days did not really help. 

Even your reduced risk. 

Did not really help this way. 

One of other people, yes, a lot easier to recover from a two% or a three person or a 5% wow down. 

One of other people. 

Yes, a lot easier to recover from a two% or a three person or a 5%. 

Wow. 

Down versus someone who is down 20%. 

We just have to see. 

This is, is this in your hands? 

Or this is not in your hands, the decision to stop at 5%, you can do some at 4%. 

Also, you can do at 3%, also you can do at 6%. 

Also, let's just say 5% that decision to stop at 5% for 10 days. 

Is this George decision or this is something that you cannot take? 

If you ignore it as you continue, then I don't blame the market. 

If this you it is your responsibility to you decide to continue risk in the money in a bad metal. 

And you going on in next six months, you will revise. 

That there are so easy days, like Adani power last mid week of April. 

There was a trend of time, 15 days, so easy that I made your NTPC are made on, you know, Adani I made money on Tata Power. 

I made on again, on Adani. 

I had I need money and oil. 

So back to back in one month, you get so many trades. 

The, and if you have size them up, your account moves so much. 

Where the next one month, which is the bad phase. 

And the right time you can So these are the simple rules that I follow for draw down and this is how I have. 

So these are the simple rules that I follow for draw down and this is how I have get my broad in single digits and have recovered from it. 

Easily in the next. 

Le if you do not keep it in single digit, if youre down 10%, you need to make way more than 10% just to break. 

Even you can do the maths. 

You can share that numbers with you. 

I'm not going to match right here. 

If you down 10 15 20% on your account, the next value. 

One thing. 

If you don't 20% I can guarantee you you mentally. 

So in a bad state that the next value might just you will take back decisions and every trade because you right now your you have a baggage of recovering of from those 20% loss and that baggage will mean that you are taking wrong decisions. 

On every trade you will move fearful, you will be cutting your trades. 

Very early, you will not follow the process. 

So the entire Valley will get wasted. 

You will not even recover your money. 

The whole Valley will get wasted. 

This game is not just about making money. 

If you make less mistakes, you add to your bottom line. 

There is, there are people who come and tell me in that I am taking a very small size position I resting. 

One year, it was a four% of 5% on his account. 

One year it was a four% of 5% on his account, those small sizes. 

This is not a complicated rocket science, simple rule, make a This is not a complicated rocket science, simple rule. 

Make a I don't even wait for 5%, probably as stopped at 3%. 

If 3% and down three%, then I take a break of few days. 

I come back with less money. 

Probably, this is why if you see on my Twitter, I've been taking trades with smaller side because of lot of moves are not sticking. 

You make decent money, which means things are working. 

You make decent money, which means things are working. 

Then, you can come back with the original capital and, and take chances. 

If things are all working, take this cube. 

I mean a longer and by them in my experience it has always happened that by them market. 

As always, I don't know and it's again opportunity time. 

So keeping losses, small is what you have to write everywhere and it is not something to be taken very lightly. 

It is a very, very crucial thing in this games. 

If you blouses small, you down from these small losses, white easily. 

The last thing is market breath, which is a should be dispersed with the advance, the class, because it's a very, very advanced concept. 

This is something. 

It's like when you are Monk, when you have already observed when to buy, sorry. 

When you when you, when you clearly know what's you need to buy and then you know at what point you need to buy them, at what point you need to sell them, how to train. 

Then once you done with all this, which will take few rates in weeks, then comes this last page. 

If you combine this study with all of the amount, it helps you in spotting easy days, over hard disk, how you can get better at it, is if you Incorporated in your, just just give it one look to understand where we are and why this works. 

If you see this, this is the most recent this first column I am lot of people here. 

Are following the sheet, right? 

In one day, the next Why not six is because in arm archrix Six is because in arm archrix lot. 

Six is because in arm archrix lot of scout was okay at 4.98 4.89. 

So two include those stocks are settled down with 4.5 4.5 is not magic. 

It's just what I sell down. 

Why am I looking at this number? 

In this entire movement, everything is In this entire movement, everything is going up. 

Do you want to be in a market? 

Where everything is going up or only few stocks are going up? 

Then fourth died down. 

And then next day, you have a And then next day, you have a big red. 

Go back to day one. 

What is the foundation of? 

How the stocks move three to five, even the breath move in the same fashion, three to five days. 

I want to take heavy risk or maybe I want to completely stay out. 



17:56
I want to take heavy risk or maybe I want to completely stay out. 



17:56
This is an advanced studies. 

This is not. 

You will not get this understanding right to way, but try and reading it every day, don't make you buy and sell decisions. 

Based on this is just to know the environment we are in. 

Are we? 

Yesterday was day, one of the Fall. 

Is this mov? 

Is this moves in Oreo Pharma day one. 

So I have in my stock and the market is also day one, then if I don't take chances on this day, then when am I going to take chance? 

I am not selling very early. 

I can. 

If this goes on for next, two days. 

I can get the moves day. 

Two sides day, two whole number. 

Either smaller response Eyes. 

Either smaller response. 

Eyes aur book. 

Most, these are the common sense things that you get better added and you keep asking yourself what you should do, there is no one answer to it, some can go for a smaller size and some can go with the bigger size but good early and not taking the position for a bigger target because it's already four days or move. 

And probably the next day there will be a slow down yesterday. 

I got Amber and Arora and it was day one for the market also. 

So I'm taking much chances probability of a good move from here is high. 

And I, in my opinion, I could be wrong. 

Also Monday will see a continuation of this movie? 

It should see a continuation of this note. 

Lot of stocks are closed right at the top. 

And 177 stocks are going up and it's day one after the correction and status. 

Same true. 

On the downside, find this fall. 

When should you play reversals with a very, very good size on these, today's, right? 

And if you go and study 12th, May Lotus names. 

13th may lot of names and reversed, right? 

After that, if I see market breath and the it's bring down so three to four days in a room. 

Then I go and aur look for emotional setups for the next. 

They are not even focused. 

On on, on continuation means. 

This column is also tells me a similar picture. 

This is number of stocks about 20 ma, which means how many stocks are below above 20 mm in this market, and if you study history, I'm sure. 

Lot of people are already. 

Have started Windows excellence. 

Yeah, almost one you are not. 

Yeah, almost one you are not. 

Every time we reach 12300 numbers, we start correcting 100. 

Again, 300. 

Now we are down this time. 

That crazy instead. 

That crazy instead 24th 24 722 while showing the chart of Nifty was. 

No, I don't track index. 

I don't look at index because the market breath tells me. 

Ved market is, I mean, how bad the market is on 24th, fair. 

This was the number of stocks down, but, well, see history. 

It has never happened in one day. 

1200 down. 

This is way overseld, which is why next, they look at the next bit after 1200 stocks down. 

Look at the next day, imagine the kind of reversals would have for you found on this day. 

700 stocks up in one day and it continued in the second day. 

The rally continue for next, three, four days. 

This is lowest This is lowest in the history before this. 

Everything. 

This was a screaming sign and I have mentioned that also extreamli high awards about good reversal from here because we were over, you know, over should category. 

But if there is a turning point, when I say turning point, I mean But if there is a turning point, when I say turning point, I mean 1500 stocks about 20, ma, go through the entire column, it has never app right from 1500. 

It corrects from 1500 It, corrects from 1500. 

We came down to slowly 500 2004170. 

So once your experience enough to study the sheet and you are at a time when market is a 1500 stocks, what should your strategy being our next few days or a few months? 

Sorry if you Wings stay out if you are if you know I mean if you are in futures having completely awarded so now because all of you beginners should only do it cash because of the the risk management and the quantity tool and all that. 

Let's say in future, you get at the state where you learn with experience went to sell. 

Don't even try there. 

We are started the scam when we are We are started the scam when we are at a very, very, very worshible level. 

And how did I make this? 

Conclusive is because life 1500, we started on 14th may. 

So on 13th may, this was the reading, only 49 73 stocks work. 

What about 20 MI? 

This is historically a very, very old very, very oversold reading. 

And probably why we reversed in. 

No time. 

We have reverse from 1732315, which is why you got mos like Amber and you getting big moves. 

Are you getting small? 

Moves is because you were at the turning point. 

Turning points are these 1500 or these two digits. 

When you get extreme numbers 339, the five days in a room, I not turning point is there when you get extreme numbers in this column, you know that turning point. 

Is there any two? 

I just like that extreme. 

This column is number of stocks up, 20% in 5 days. 

We started it, pick Pick coin. 

Pick coincide with this column also. 

And then we started coming down and this is also historically low, very low. 

Number 85 stocks were down 20% and time days and look at this. 

Now, we are councing. 

But this study, If you continue this exercise every morning before the start of the day or every evening before the start on next, there you get better at it. 

If you continue this exercise every morning before the start of the day or every evening before the start on next, there you get better at it. 

I write this comments with. 

I am not writing these comments. 

Everyday why? 

Because not everyday. 

It matters. 

It matters are all the turn around a lot. 

Look at this. 

Then I know that Bulls are strong and this is the market I should be coming back to So if you don't exhaust based on this, So if you don't exhaust based on this, then you go through dance. 

You end up giving lot of games that you made and this is an advanced study. 

Well, once you get this once you very good become good at this, you become the trading amount is completely on affected with the outside world and is only focused on this. 

I can tell you, give you one guarantee in a someone can prove it like yes. 

Trading Baba. 

If on this day when 85 is also a down in five days go and look at Money Control on newspaper, in was pay full of all the negative news. 

Yes or no. 

I think this is the day and moving a lot of creating house houses, but the rating on it stocks in Indian GDP. 

Also, they this day then 1200 stocks were down. 

Go read the paper. 

Go read the money control. 

It's all spreading the panic, but if you believe this study, which you win, if you put in the effort after every extreme number, I am make easy money. 

These are the easy ways that I make. 

My ventrate is really good. 

I can, and I do size on this, this is the that's the only use of I do. 

It's not that you not It's not that you not finding trades. 

What are the odds? 

What are the odds are fine trades? 

There is no end to all and all but my advice There is no end to all and all but my advice to all of you especially the extremely new ones or the struggling ones, whatever I have covered is enough for you to stand on your feet. 

Never taught anyone never. 

Never taught. 

Anyone never taught anyone how to send but I can, I mean introduced people who are have understood the concepts properly and they are selling. 

There is this guy yesterday? 

Someone was buying orofa options. 

There is nothing wrong in that u. 

Once you get the concept right there, is this guy I only talking all these concepts and he is only place reversal. 

In Nifty options Bank, 50 options because reversal concept is true for every instrument and I prove it am. 

I have I not it works in every on every instrument it if the stock is. 

Now if the whatever time frame, you looking at 3 minute, 10 minute, whatever minutes if it is down, 67, 5 bar in a row, it is it, there is a tendency that it will give us. 

Some Bounce could be big Bounce or a small counts. 

So he understood that concept well and he is been trading only Bank, Nifty and Nifty with that because Nifty are very liquid, he does size. 

He makes I mean I don't want to get into the money is 30 makes because there's no everyone has a different accounts but he makes good money. 

Forget the custom broad and he makes in lakhs whatever. 

Who can create a only the ones? 

Who can create a only the ones, good observation skills and they are reading the trades. 

Well, every few days and then the improvise, there is one more. 

I, you also only treasure, he only trades Just Dial reversals or big name reversals and he has made lot of money. 

Every time was up these reversals, he has played relevant here. 

Him to only revers I am totally the concepts, and this is what he was settled on where and he is not looking continuation. 

Some people are not okay. 

With revers like yesterday it's challenging which I am not denying it is challenging but like before this boot camp, you never new words from start is and you were buying only this box break out similarly. 

Have better faster, moves better win rate. 

Have better faster, moves better wind rate and you can do size if I want 55000 or 60000 one lakh shares at one price. 

It's not easy. 

So these are the things. 

If you come with an open mind Ek changes, your power. 

You will thinking and things can start working for you. 

So these concepts whatever covered is enough for you to make a career out of it and get creative with it. 

If there is something that I would like to add on, I will make a video on it and I'll put it on the website on the app. 

Next classes will be on the question answers where Next classes will be on the question answers where I will tell you how to ask your questions. 

And in this world duration, if I have something to add I will So that's it from my side and So that's it from my side and all the best not that we are not talking again. 

But yeah, all the best whatever work was left to review. 

This. 

I'll review with this week before the Monday and then we can move fall from people were not submitted, they work it's alright. 

Whatever work has been submitted by others, learn from those slides. 

It's not just myself in those side. 

The very important to look at. 

You can learn a lot from it. 

Keep looking at other slides also 

18:12
Keep looking at other slides also 

18:12
Because every sentence Because all that take a break and then we rever work and let's start taking trade and and small size.
