# When to Let Go - Trading Rules

## Overview

Knowing when to let go of a position is crucial for trading success. This document outlines the key rules for identifying when to exit positions to maximize profits and minimize opportunity costs.

## Position Management Categories

### Technical Indicators

#### Extended/Parabolic Moves
**When to Let Go:** Exit positions when the price movement becomes parabolic or extends too rapidly.

**Why This Happens:** Extended moves create unsustainable price action that requires significant digestion time. The steeper the angle of ascent, the more time the stock needs to consolidate afterward.

**Key Indicators:**
- Price movement at 90-degree angles or steeper
- Rapid gains exceeding normal move patterns
- Climax bars indicating exhaustion

**Example:** A stock that moves 90% in 6 days creates a parabolic rise that kills the stock for many weeks, requiring extended rest periods.

#### Old vs Young Moves
**When to Let Go:** Exit positions when they become "old" - typically after 100%+ gains from the original base.

**Why This Happens:** Old moves lose momentum and become tired. Young moves offer better opportunities with fresh energy and stronger upward potential.

**Key Indicators:**
- Position has gained 100% or more from initial entry
- Move has been ongoing for extended periods
- Stock shows signs of exhaustion or fatigue

**Example:** A position that has moved from its original base and gained significant percentage becomes an old move that should be exited in favor of fresh opportunities.

### Market Behavior Rules

#### Digestion Period Requirement
**When to Let Go:** Exit positions when they require digestion after significant moves.

**Why This Happens:** Stocks need time to consolidate after big moves. During digestion periods, capital is tied up without generating returns, representing opportunity cost.

**Key Indicators:**
- Stock has made significant gains (30-50%+) in short timeframes
- Price action shows signs of consolidation or sideways movement
- Volume decreases significantly after active periods

**Resting Period Guidelines:**
- Minimum 15 days for proper digestion
- Optimal range: 20-25 days for full consolidation
- Rarely works with less than 7-10 days

**Example:** A stock that gained 34% in 4 days needs adequate time to digest before the next move becomes viable.

#### Resting Period Violation
**When to Let Go:** Exit positions when they fail to show proper resting behavior after moves.

**Why This Happens:** Stocks that don't respect proper resting periods often indicate weak underlying momentum or lack of institutional interest.

**Key Indicators:**
- Stock attempts to move again before adequate rest
- Previous resting period was insufficient (less than 15 days)
- Price action shows weakness during attempted new moves

**Example:** A stock that moves 50%+ and attempts another move after only 7 days typically fails, indicating the need for proper digestion time.

### Strategic Considerations

#### Opportunity Cost Consideration
**When to Let Go:** Exit positions when better opportunities arise or when capital could be deployed more effectively.

**Why This Happens:** Holding onto tired positions prevents participation in new, potentially more profitable moves. The market offers continuous opportunities that require available capital.

**Key Indicators:**
- New valid setups appear while capital is tied up
- Current position shows limited upside potential
- Better risk-reward opportunities emerge elsewhere

**Strategic Consideration:** Always evaluate whether current positions represent the best use of available capital compared to new opportunities.

#### Reversal Duration Limitation
**When to Let Go:** Exit reversal positions after 3-5 days maximum, regardless of profit target.

**Why This Happens:** Reversals are counter-trend moves with shorter lifespans. Unlike continuations that can last weeks or months, reversals work against the prevailing trend and have limited duration.

**Key Indicators:**
- Position is a reversal trade (counter-trend)
- More than 3 days have passed without reaching target
- Move shows signs of losing momentum
- Market trend remains strongly against the reversal direction

**Time Constraint:** Reversals cannot sustain for extended periods due to their counter-trend nature, requiring earlier exits than continuation moves.

## Implementation Framework

1. **Monitor Position Age:** Track how long positions have been held and their percentage gains
2. **Assess Move Quality:** Evaluate whether current moves are sustainable or extended
3. **Calculate Opportunity Cost:** Compare current position potential with new opportunities
4. **Respect Resting Periods:** Allow adequate time for stocks to consolidate after significant moves
5. **Prioritize Young Moves:** Focus capital on fresh, energetic moves rather than tired positions

## Key Principles

- **Time is Capital:** Every day capital is tied up in a position represents opportunity cost
- **Quality over Quantity:** Better to have fewer, high-quality moves than many mediocre ones
- **Market Efficiency:** The market continuously offers new opportunities that require available capital
- **Risk Management:** Letting go prevents holding onto losing or stagnant positions

## Conclusion

Effective position management requires knowing when to let go as much as knowing when to enter. By following these rules, traders can optimize capital allocation, reduce opportunity costs, and participate in the best available moves in the market.
