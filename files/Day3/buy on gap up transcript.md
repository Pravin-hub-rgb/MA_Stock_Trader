70% James. 

So yeah, I this is a very easy point. 

There is no conclusion about it. 

I hope this is clear right now how to buy gap UPS. 

There will be some setups you have been. 

I am on this set of very nicely. 

They are narrow range there.

How to buy on gap up? 

But the next day find a situation like this. 

I was angry the stop rising. 

20 price goes below and ghost. 

I right around that line. 

And the next day I want to get an early but you don't want it closes act, 22 it opposite. 

232 at opened four cos iron. 

Come on. 

Ask me in Monday. 

I think Khushboo did not wrong. 

The LG quick stock had gap up 10%. 

So some I think she asked me that what to do in cases, should they go from our Studio? 

You get, if you get 15% move on an average, already up 10% You get if you get 15% move on an average, already up 10% now you ask yourself. 

Do you want to get into the smooth to make that 5% and risk your money? 

These are again common sense. 

Things does not require any training. 

It just need the remainder that how you need to think over possible. 

Still gap which I can go for because it still 15% 20%. 

I can get 10% is now I'm not touching. 

So in this case, how would I catch this? 

Go and Twitter, you can find that I could just late. 

This is second marks. 

How is this first three minutes looking to strong? 

It's open very strong clearly evidence from the huge gap up and it stayed strong. 

It is still acting very strong, so I just place the bed above the eye of the day and I was able to it. 

And this is where in the next few day. 

Next two days. 

I close majority around this level and then the remaining but trained and stop it. 

NTPC NTPC are already important education and not covering and this is a very, very advanced skill. 

Don't even try and this patient moves. 

This is let's leave it for the booster dose, which happens for five months from now, let's say. 

But this is just like, all right, this is just like a gap up. 

Shut up very nicely. 

And then next slide gaps up. 

Is this a similar kind of right? 

Like oil, how does it look bullish or very, very bad? 

Yes. 

Or no. 

It's somebody said, average, average is in the first few minutes. 

Next few days, Next few days I took it like this I to majority in anticipation when I added some on this day. 

Three minutes, third sign, and I want don't I want you do not make this as a condition Three minutes third sign and I want don't I want you do not make this as a condition? 

The third sign around. 

Discussing volume in first five, 10 minutes at times. 

Where what? 

BSc on this brain? 

In the first two minutes? 

What is the average volume? 

Onevsc on this day. 

What is the average volume? 

Average volume. 

Not the trade, total volume of that day. 

Average volume is 2.13 when I got BSc in first five minutes, the volume was already 25% of the day of the average like the average just two million, 5 lakh shares were already treated in the first five minutes. 

Now is it at difficult into understand that evidence? 

First five minutes, 25% volume is done by the end of the day to be a very, very high volume, am I, right? 

So this also is a start So this also is a start is a strong start sign, even NTPC and oil. 

All these stocks NTPC on this day. 

If you see first three minutes, the average volume before this, they was 12 million in the first three minutes. 

Work. 

For 3 million was already done in three minutes. 

Close to 25 30% was already done in first three minutes. 

So which means this gap up which means this gap up is backed by big players. 

This will not have three minute. 

Introduce three for that November. 

Let's see. 

15 minutes. 

I don't know why it's 6:15 and it's so morning. 

Well, but if you see it's it's an encourage intraday chart, but you can go verify when this breakout happened on a gap up. 

The average volume was, you can verify this, on spider. 

Also, the average volume. 

So if you have options, like if you have options and then you see one name starting on a very strong note on a very high volume. 

So if you have options, like, if you have options and then you see one name starting on a very strong note on a very high volume, that takes my that gets my priority.
