Third day, you will be out by then already. 

Let me now. 

Go back to how to reduce the size of your box list. 

The idea is like, said not to have many names. 

The idea is like said not to have many names and you have names that can work that the high probability to work, that's all I can be wrong. 

There will be a time where even thes that you selected will not work life. 

For example, Island on the day. 

It moved, I wanted to give but I wanted to just keep my list sort and I just choose something else overdeemar and dmart move very, very lost out. 

Did not move this not. 

Anything outside, it is not It is not in. 

It is not in your control and then you have to let go. 

So, how do I sell make my collection? 

1% maximum 2% to an officent. 

1% maximum 2% to an officent. 

So I take one person. 

Stop. 

Let's say there is a stock Let's say there is a stock. 

I am interested him and it's for 2000 rupees and there is one more option, which is 15 rupees. 

It's point05. 

It's point05. 

So this is the moment and no one thing change that if it has to move from 50, it will go to 50.05. 

Then 50 one. 

Then 50.15 point20 and like that. 

Basic why you can D? 

Mart is what volume on this way. 

On D, Mart 1.8. 

Basic why you can D? 

Mart is what volume on this way. 

On D, Mart 1.8 million, what is the volume here? 

Same trade, same stock. 

In BSE is one 120000 where you have 20 lakh shares here, only one lakh shares. 

So this is the simple reason why? 

I don't read the stock because there is no liquidity. 

There is no liquidity and you can verified once also. 

So, come with coming back to the point. 

No beastly stocks now. 

So this is how stocks move and if it has to go down it will go down like this, right? 

There's no other way. 

So if I take a trade, which is at 15, and as I pray it with the one person stop, what is my 1% stop.5, which is how many takes away if there are 20 takes in one Rupee 1.1 from 50 to 49. 

It is 206 from 49. 

So everyone point move is 20 tics. 

So everyone point move is 20 tics. 

So, if I am taking the stop, if I'm buying is 50 rupees with the one person stop I stop is is 0.5 which is only 10tics distance on the other hand. 

On the other hand, if I have a 2000 f, i take it with 1%. 

Stop. 

Margin higher, they both are one person stops. 

Margin higher. 

They both are one person stops but I safe or on a 20 rupees for because that every take there is some buying a there is there is some bit placed and it will not be and the it can get it, anything will happen but the if I have to compare the safety is here. 

So this rules out why I did not give tiles the other day. 

I avoid a smaller price of and if I, if I, you see me taking it probably and I am taking it with a wider stock because then only I can have a bigger safety spread is expensive when nutrient in liquid form. 

Reliance is a very expenses stock, but the spread is same five text because it's still liquid, sorry it's liquid. 

The spread is bad. 

When you trading Elite stocks, it has nothing to do with the price of this out. 

It is about the liquidity anyway. 

So 1 point is how I reduce, how I reduce my watchlist is priority to expensive over cheaper. 

Stocks second is, if I have sector moves yesterday. 

In this list. 

In this week, we had one day where all metal stocks were down a lot. 

Yes, or no Tata Steel Vedanta JSW Steel and alcohol. 

Then, am I priority is those names simple? 

Then am I priority is those names? 

Simple. 

There was now I think it stocks are doing the same as metal. 

So if I have many iit's calls which are down a lot, they were actually. 

Now what is already saved. 

They were download they before yesterday before this yesterday's rally. 

So my priority is, if I have many names from one sector -2cosis is there? 

Because then the sector moves together, which is why it's more incidence. 

It's no surprise to me that they all move together on this day. 

It 17th may. 

This is how the Janta. 

Hoon 17th may Hind. 

17th. 

May JSW Steel moved 17th May attainment. 

I hope this is clear. 

There is no confusion about it. 

Next is fast moves over slow moves. 

If you see on the left, this is the adr number simply means, average duration, range, average daily rain, sorry. 

Which means how much percentage on an average stock moves over a period of time. 

This is the 20 period value, which means in the last 20 days, Tata Steel has gone on 3.44 up or 3.44 down. 

That's the average versus Mirza is. 

How much 6.9? 

So this obviously most faster all are Infosys. 

What is the average move? 

So and this is a slow moving storm. 

Now, if you buy Infosys, are you going to get 15% more in next three to five days. 

So you are wasting your time if you get into Infosys, an expecting 15%, you have free to get into Infosys. 

I not stopping from getting into emphasis, but then your expectation should not be or 15% moved. 

How much just study Infosys 4% 5 6%, this is sorry not 8% 5%. 

So clearly the best moves are also not even reaching double digit. 

So if it's a four digits of I is this clear ltr? 

This is the rupees of the adr is 3.7. 

Is this clear LT? 

This is the rupees stock. 

The adr is 3.79 for of 4000 rupees ka, which it means, it means it moves. 

It moves 150 points on an average M even though it's a four product Idea is very high. 

I hope this point is clear Wipro, very, very soon. 

So I avoid all these names because they will not move. 

And if I, I'm targeting three to five, if my money is important that I am going to pocket where I can make fast money and bromine faster alight. 

So anything less than other is values of I avoid. 

And this is how I cut down my list based on these three points. 

When one quality, which is way. 

Most important is the consolidation quality. 

I don't want issues. 

I don't want issues now. 

What do you mean by issues? 

When I say issues I means hurdles orders are big selling days massive selling days. 

Like 4% 5% 10% down is on a very very high volume average volume. 

This is the average volume line if the volume is VMA too much and the fall is really big then that that decreases the quality of the dusting period. 

And why is in a problem? 

I don't know about institutional selling or no, but I lost for sure is that there is a huge hurdle. 

I don't know about institutional selling or no, but I lost for sure is that there is a huge hurdle. 

This is not, this is the perfect example. 

Let me find the bad examples. 

Bad examples is given if you study batch, this is what I have included. 

Yes, i h October last year you was chuj, rise near parabola. 

And if I see the percentage arise, this is 40% and five days. 

Now, if the price Old, almost got trapped here. 

Old. 

Almost got trapped. 

Here they are waiting for their price to come so that they can exit yes or no. 

So because this is so fresh, it's only two, three days. 

That there is a good chance. 

Lot of people are still holding it as the time. 

Progresses. 

The number of people still hold in the position will be less compared to the fresh examples because probably the broker sold it of Denver paid the money, that's the required to pay. 

If they were on loan they must be out by now. 

So compared if I compare this point with see the struggle every time it is going up. 

It's not sustaining not sustaining right? 

And not sustaining, right? 

So, look at this biggest failure, which is wire in this case, even though it was a huge buying force, narrow range, this rising 20, but a bad set of because suggestion. 

So what I need need to do is So what I need need to do is I not considering this at this point I need to do. 

What can anyone tell me what I need to do? 

Thoughts. 

Let it go now. 

Yes, wait for 15 to 10 days few days. 

Give it time, let it rest because by then you will all these people who are track. 

Some of them are it will be out and probably they got out. 

Look at this. 

They got some people who are trap, they were, they got the chance to exit them. 

I assumed and all then again, second chance to exit another out on this day everybody. 

So this is the IAS point and today grossed, right? 

This is not a problem anymore because this level has been crossed. 

This is not a problem anymore because this level has been crossed. 

So I am assuming that all the people who are trapped here out. 

It was a problem here. 

It was a problem here, but now it is not a problem. 

Is this point clear? 

Now, the new problem is this current, this is now my latest problem, because this is also a bad rejection De use selling on a very high volume struggling. 

Now, it's been how many days since that last problem. 

How many days 11 bar? 

12 days, right? 

As long as it's 10 days old, I don't find it a problem. 

So now this was a problem. 

This green Arrow day was a problem here, but now it's been 10 days. 

Now, the overall consolidation quality as no issues. 

Now, the overall consolidation quality as no issues. 

This was the issue here already cross on this day, this was an issue here. 

Now it's time based based on the time wasteful life always already, being 10 days or more, I don't consider as a problem and then if it's accept, now, I will take the trade and look at this. 

Now, blasted without any struggle, in three days, you got or move of 9%. 

You let it. 

So the consolidation quality, I mean, is when you selecting a set up, make sure that you don't have big days, big fall days on a big volume. 

If there is one you need to give it time after the 10 day. 

Period is crossed. 

Then that struggle is not a struggle, any Mortal? 

Alright, yes, or no. 

I can give more exam. 

One more example before, BSc. 

What about BSc here about BCM this day? 

Do you see stable clean consolidation? 

Clean resting period with no issues. 

Probably why I got clear moves Mirza when I got Mirza here, this is your one high also. 

They but the day is it skill 7% looks right? 



15:16
Because it's Over. 

It's not a red day. 

So you see any order layer in this listing period, Adani power or the most recent winners? 

Do you see, do you see a hotel, the common sense behind this? 

The basic principle behind this is, if you are selecting the side of which has less goals, it will whenever the price moves are, it will face bless issues in going simple. 

There is no problem science behind if your buying a stock, which is full of high, volume days, full of high volume days. 

It will struggle. 

It will take time crossing that level, and you need to give the time. 

It's like, let it digest. 

Let it get ready. 

And how much is the time to 20 days diagrams? 

Clearly the volume, the are over. 

Do you Clearly the volume the are over. 

Do you see any order? 

When I M new seat big down days on a big volume. 

So no hurther the probably. 

Why clean moves Adani Enterprises? 

I think I bought somewhere around. 

Yeah. 

Do you see any point is very clear. 

It's not just narrow range the problem in. 

I don't know why again. 

I don't know why again on, maybe a never tendency that. 

Again on, maybe a never tendency that the set of Again on maybe a never tendency that the set of is trade. 

And in the concept is that we are trading tide base between tide based. 

Maybe everyone is rushing into finding narrow range. 

This narrow range is not the reason why the stock is exploring. 

It is not the reason why the stock is exploring narrow range. 

Only indicates that. 

A strong stock has gone dull. 

A very, very tight. 

That's it. 

Look at this. 

Look at this. 

So many big and then all these narrating based are not giving you, so, you reduce your probability, you reduce your chances. 

If you are trading stocks and ignoring the consolidation politics. 

And at times, even with this, you will have aur probably 10 list 10 names in the list. 

And at times, even with this, you will have aur probably 10 list 10 names in the list on those days. 

Just do first form first pick second, or with seven eight, seldong, with 78. 

Like I said, listen to me settle down with 78 names. 

Even after doing this, these three steps there will be. 

There is very will have Bajaj finance and I will not select Bajaj Finance because I am already. 

I have already found seven names like already found seven names or eight names and I did not select dmart and dmart still went up. 

My it was my decision to settle out with 57 names and just focus there. 

It's not that I never made money on on those five minutes. 

I may not have made money on Bajaj finance and demon but I made money on the ones I made selected. 

That's isn't that the goal that you need to make money or your goal, is to make money fromance or dead. 

If you have, laser sharp focus, you will tend to make money regularly. 

If you work everywhere then you watchlist but no red, no result. 

Also simple. 

Also simple in which strong start to choose. 

This is very easy. 

There is no, and this is not difficult thing to understand. 

Let's say discuss the examples that are shared in in this week yesterday. 

This was your watchlist. 

Also simple. 

Also simple. 



16:11
So to answer Bajaj Finance all there may be of just first come first served and did not have demand also simple which strong start. 

So to answer Bajaj Finance all there may be of just first come first served and did not have demand also simple which strong start to choose. 

This is very easy. 

There is no, and this is not be a difficult thing to understand. 

Let's say discuss the examples that I share in, in this week yesterday. 

This was your watchlist, I shared, right? 

This is the I said with you guys, right? 

The stop to move, 12%, 6%. 

And these these stocks did not move. 

Let us see how these two open and how the other three, four, all these stocks opening. 

This is the three minutes chart. 

How is the 3 minute bar? 

How is the 3 minute bar? 

Where is the closing? 

Where is the closing of this? 

Three minute bar, I mean near the high right? 

At the highest point, almost near the high of the day, top of the range. 

So, if I have a stock this is it is trading with right at the higher the day. 

Can I call it strong? 

It is not only starting from it, state strong. 

What is the, how is the closing of orobind that point? 

It's, it started strong with same open and low and it stayed from. 

What is the, how is the opening of Lal Path? 

If I looking at daily, If I looking at daily, if I only looking a daily, the price would be somewhere like the body is not full. 

You have a huge pick right at the top. 

So out of the three options, if you are picking your system tells you to go for strong stocks what will you go after? 

It's a very simple. 

Common sense time that if I have to pick a strong candidate go for once which are acting strong behaving. 

Strong need price action. 

So there is this is no brain that I have all these 78 names and looking for the one that starts from and stay strong in the first three minutes, even previous names during, remember names that I said before, give me one name. 

So there is, this is no brain that I have all these 78 names and looking for the one that starts from and stay strong in the first three minutes, even previous names during, remember, names that I said before, give me one name, Sudarshan, this is the day. 

When Sudarshan work, 18th, may, this is the 18th may first opening, is this a strong start and strong 3 minutes behavior? 

Maybe that is why do work. 

So basically you just creating odds and your favour, it does not guarantee that, okay? 

It is stain from and this will work and it is also not a guarantee of these stock stocks state weak in the first three minutes and they will never work. 

But we are talking about probability. 

What is the probability of things working in your favour anything? 

Which is Buddhist from right from the first minute and staying bullish. 

And going after that we all that. 

What is It wasn't really have about not ask as the other one but not as bad as all these names. 

It wasn't really have about not ask as the other one, but not as bad. 

As all these names, maybe I would not take it, but if I add or not only taking two trails, I Would Still want for Amber and arrow. 

But this is still not as bad as all the Tech Mahindra and petrol Albert where they closed this erase only from the one person. 

This is only 30% genes. 

The other one is 70% James. 

So yeah, I this is a very easy point. 

There is no conclusion about it. 

I hope this is clear right
