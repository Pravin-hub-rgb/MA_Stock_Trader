Let's let's start with the first thing, which is the most difficult part of this game. 

Is it is went to self why? 

This is difficult as because when you buy, you already know that I'm looking for an Arrow range and, and buying about, probably let's say, previously, high or when there is a strong start. 

And I see because three minutes lot of good action and happening the price is really strong abide. 

That's and you know that your stock is, let's say you buy 100, you know, that you stop is 98. 

So there is no confusion, you know, that you will exit at 98 M, right? 

Is there? 

Confusion next. 

Easiest part of this whole game who everybody I have ded with so many people. 

Probably in just one month. 

Because Because, you know, that you will get out of 98 when the stock, but you don't know at 115. 

Whether this number to 117 or it will come to 103, or it will go to 110 that confusion, that will that tool grid or fear stops you from I think if free issue that happens, right? 

So, this is why the soul selling part is the tricist of the Lord of the entire gave that you hit part of like the stock market game. 

When you have to make money win, the most difficult part is going to cell. 

And which I can tell you that it will, you will not learn it overnight. 

You will have to go through few trades to to handle different situations. 

And lot of discretion is involved in 20 sel, but this can be solved to a great extent. 

Good videos of goods or interviews, they all emphasize on having sell rules. 

Could you be? 

They all emphasize on having sell rules. 

Could you be my They all emphasize on having sell rules. 

Could you be myself rules? 

Like for example, if I make a rule that I will select 10%. 

That's my shall rule. 

Now, if I make that rule and the stock goes to 15%, I made the group rule to select 10%. 

Then I should not be upset about it. 

If it goes to 15% then I should not be absent about If it goes to 15%, then I should not be absent. 

About market did not tell me to make a rule of 10%. 

No one would be to make a rule of 10%. 

I'm sure you must have heard this line that whatever happens in the market is georged me. 

What? 

I'm sure you must have heard this line that whatever happens in the market is georged me. 

What does it mean? 

It is just It is just everyday market. 

Sellers are selling placing cells. 

Sellers are selling placing cells. 

That's all how I interpret. 

The whole information is my is on me, probably the same price action. 

You were integrating as well, and I might into integrated as bearish. 

Is it? 

Because of is it markings responsibility. 

It's my it was my decision. 

So we may whatever belief that like example, my belief is after narrow range. 

This there is an expensive. 

That's my beliefs. 

No one gave me that believe. 

That's my observation market did not tell me to observe it like that. 

Maybe that observation is right? 

Maybe it is wrong. 

Only the result can say. 

So whatever you, if you making money in this market, it's you it's because of your effort is because of your interpretation and you acted on it. 

You place a heavy better on it and you made lot of money out of it. 

Is your responsibility. 

Similarly, if you lose money in the market really bad and you continue to to trade every day, is it market fault or your fault? 

Yeah, sorry, right. 

It's my salt, it's every day. 

It's bumpy is I am losing money back to back 234 days and I still go and every day. 

Well, that's my fault. 

It's not market fault. 

So my point here is, if I making sell rules, then outside whatever happens outside those rules this. 

Now today when I cover cell, Now today, when I cover cell, I can tell you him. 

If you do not make the cell rules, If you do not make the cell every time you buy a stock, Yesterday, somebody on the telegram message that keep what Amber, and he sold pretty early because he was nervous looking at the profit. 

Message that keep what Amber and he sold pretty early because he was nervous looking at the profit. 

He Message that keep what Amber and he sold pretty early because he was nervous looking at the profit he was not losing money. 

He was making money, but yes, he was. 

No was because he was fearful that he will lose that money. 

Having name was narration sometime. 

If I not wrong, he message yesterday saying the same thing that I'm discussing today that she because he does not. 

He never knew the exact he just entered and you making money, but because he does not know the exit. 

So he just exerted and then it went higher. 

You also that went higher around 11% and close their at 11%, yes or no. 

So the importance of cell rules are. 

And once you make those, once you make those rules, And once you make those, once you make those rules, then you need to follow those rules. 

And is on the stock is going outside it. 

Then I should not be abstract about it because this is what I made. 

You should I should be happy with I am getting because based on those rules then I should not be afraid. 

Similarly, if I one more the I'll tell you another side, if I make a rule that I will select, let's say half at 10%. 

Now the stock goes to eight percent 8% and reverses and hits your stop. 

Reverses from 8% and hits your stock. 

You will be upset about it. 

Right? 

Why did not close that 8%? 

Because simply because I don't have the crystal ball to tell me that. 

This one is going only to 8% and reversing from there. 

If I had one, then I have been a billionaire already. 

So because I have one rule that I select 8%, so he 10%. 

And if it reverse is to 8%, then I again should not be upset about it. 

I should take that information as I should take that information as the market is, not that strong. 

Lot of stocks are not reaching even 10%. 

Then what do I do? 

That's I take that sign as a as an information, I take that information and act on it. 

In the coming trades. 

I can may be choose to reduce my targets because the markets are is not very strong. 

So if you do not, So if you do not, if you just stubborn on only selling at 10% and markets are not if you have four positions and all the positions are not even reaching 10 and reversing and hitting our stock. 

That's my feedback from the market that but insure getting upset just to the new situation, you reduce your target or just completely or be other one to save energy and not waste and energy. 

In the markets are not even moving. 

10% and sale that energy for days when you can get beginners. 

Because there was even in the last since this year, since January, there are been many faces where we have. 

Got forget. 

10%, we are getting 50. 

70%. 

Last in March. 

Sorry in mid April. 

I think lot of power stocks Adani, power, Tata Power, NTPC, they all gave 3050. 

70% of 100%. 

And if you keep the drawdowns Limited when when the well things get bad, when things are rough. 

And if you keep the drawdowns Limited when, when the well things get bad, when things are rough. 

So the So the now to get him to detail of going to sell, I believe that selling depends on a lot on your, on your Lifestyle, on your free time. 

How much free time? 

And you do not want, you do not have the Liberty or the time. 

And you do not want, you do not have the Liberty or the time to find raise we day. 

Then you need a system where you get few trees in a year. 

Then you need a system where you get few trees in a year, but you get big wins. 

Because you are taking fear traits. 

Because you are taking fear traits. 

So you need bigs so that you add up really strong in that year, on the other hand, if you someone with lot of time, if you have someone who can manage time in the first one hour and every evening, then three to five days, is your window to rotate your money and grow your account much faster. 

Why? 

Now, most of you have seen it. 

Now, most of you have seen it right. 

We are reacting to the price action. 

We are reacting to the price action. 

Still easier to tell what is happening. 

In the next way to five days over next three to five months, am I right? 

It's easy to tell the, you know that you already know today that in the next three to five days. 

Obviously, this requires more screen time. 

Obviously this requires more screen time. 

So now I don't have one cell rule that fix all because that is not fair and someone's busy. 

You need a Cell rule which is letting you in the position. 

Like for example, probably you buy somewhere like just and just giving an example like probably you enter. 

This, this narrow range is the valid or not. 

So someone with less time is entering here and probably riding the move, which is around 127 bus moving. 

Only 86 barsurafly for five months, on the other hand, someone who is has more time. 

Here, there is a trade here. 

So in this entirements I have one, two, three, four, five, So in this entirements I have one, two, three, four, five, five definite trades, which move to the extent of this is the magnitude that I got. 

So just for the calculations Ek, Even if you let's say even if you don't make 127% if you even if you make close to it or around it you are like the person a was sitting through all this entire mode. 

Even if you let's say even if you don't make 127% if you even if you make close to it or around it you are like the person a was sitting through all this entire mode, the advantage that that some of you might ignore is your avoiding this this period. 

And this long sideways period which lasted from December mid to ninth March. 

So for on three months, three months, this whole body period, you could have awarded. 

So the person being avoids it the fees only playing for three to five years of both and you, yes, you keep your money available for others ATS which may work faster than BSc may work. 

Slow then BST, but the bigger advantage that I see that I have witness written as I feel it because you guess the new the biggest advantage is when markets crack, I might draw downs are Limited, which is what I said. 

If you want to avoid withdraw dance, what are the strategies? 



10:10
So this is one strategy if you playing for three to five. 

Move and not looking beyond it, then you are making sure that you account also does not go through deep brought down because if someone is if the person is buying BSc here, his, how would his broad down be from BSc in those four days very sharp, right? 

So, focus on learnings answer. 

Of course, you don't make 127% moon. 

Of course, you don't make 127% moon. 

But someone someone wants to like there are two ways of growing your account very fast. 

Some like everyone. 

Not everyone is like same, some have a higher ris and some are lower risk. 

Apartites something go through big, bro, dance on cannot go through big broad ons. 

So if I want to make 100% at the cost of keeping my bro, very limited. 

Then I cannot play more than three to five days. 

Some people were okay with big, bro, dance. 

But because they are not, they don't have the time to, to, like a buy stocks everyday, and turn the money the way, because it requires lot of screen time. 

Then they don't have a choice, but they have to write the trades f, or as long as the trade allows for as long as the trade loss and make the most of it. 

So, the Turbo will be less, but there returns can be really good. 

And first in the other category that turnover is really like you taking more trades, but if you take good size trades, you can make grow your account to lots faster. 

Without going through the worry of the big throw downs. 

Yeah. 

So I'm discussing now how I managed the trees that I took. 

So this is when I bought the day, I got out of this. 

It had a strong start and I was in this trade around, I think around 191 or something. 

So because I know what is the three days limit 15 to 20%. 

So what I do is what I want you to do is cell 50% position at 15%. 

Now some will reverse from 14%, some will cross this 15% thum will go to 50. 

Let's say 20% also. 

That's not my what is in my hand. 

My I can decide where to exit that I have that freedom to decide way to exact market does not source. 

Once you sell half position in profit, Once you sell half position in profit, do you really feel light and easy for the remaining trade? 

After that, once the trade becomes risk, free, forget 50% on. 

After that, once the trade becomes risk, free forget 50%. 

Once it becomes risk free once let's say the position is of 8%. 

The position is not 8% and I am moving my stop to post. 

Even at that point I have feel really relaxed. 

So what I'm trying to do is I not trying to make money here. 

I am trying to keep my head like Peace of Mind, keep my headlight my clinity inside so that I don't lose with. 

Like I sold a lonely power, a good quantity at Like I sold a lonely power. 

I think I should hear somewhere. 

I think I should hear somewhere edges is going on and if I less forget the whole trend if I for follow the three to five, they move it went up. 

Another 38 39% now. 

Should I just cry overhead for move on to something else? 

Because there is now you have already seen in this last one week. 

You have already seen that is not shortage of opportunities, is there? 

You are not buying a couple handle, which takes about three to four weeks to come. 

At least you're not buying a rectangle break out that what you already, what you used to you, may not buying a triangle break out the formations of triangles and all that takes weeks to form. 

So you don't which means you don't have trains everyday. 

But now, buying was not has allowed you. 

As is offering, you trace everyday. 

Am I right? 

So now you don't has shortage, you have probably like new confused, you have many options. 

Now, the problem is not shorters, the problem is you have lot of options. 

So once I sell half after that, I should just be worried about the remaining half instead of worrying about why should why did I say that half? 

You have to consciously You have to consciously, every time I get a negative thought, I tell my feed myself with positive because is this is a very lonely business. 

You don't have colleagues here. 

You don't have you not working with friends. 

You have to keep telling yourself that it's all right. 

These are muscles. 

And I keep going on an And I keep going on. 

Anode worried about. 

I don't I don't get. 

So why do I don't get so? 

Am I am machine? 

No, because all these years I have trained myself that there is I have I have strongly believe that there is no shortage. 

I strongly believe that there is no shortage so the chromos is not there. 

A lot of moves, I don't buy. 

But people, I work with our train where they buy, but I don't have it somewhere. 

I am I they don't have it. 

I don't get out. 

He has written. 

I don't have it because that's not my business. 

I have to I am capable of finding trades and I have been doing it and I can continue to, as long as the market opens. 

So, Now, the score is doing I think value well, Now the score is doing, I think value well in the next three days, in some 17%. 

So you have position, get sold in the next three days and then it continuous higher move to 40% finally triggers 10 on this day and 20 on this day. 

Obviously, the 10 will get triggered. 

So, the person be, if I aming with 20, then my stroke, the 3504 versus your stop is at 10 is that 395? 

So, the person be, if I aming with 20, then my stroke, the 3504 versus your stop is at 10, is that 395. 

So, your risking less that's could be at one, but this advantage is, sometimes, the train will get triggered. 

This is not best example. 

Yeah. 

See this your 10 triggered here, but with 20, let's say you entered here and the remaining half position but triggered here, if you trailing a 10, what is the stock is really, really, you know, good strong trend. 

I got the word address, 61%. 

So there is a full goal 30%, like it's double. 

So obviously everything has a phenomenon Pro like there are propose and calls it again it with time you will realize what's you more. 

Risking Risking living lot of money on the table, or you absolutely don't want to leave money on the table. 

So your skin. 

You just telling with the 10 moving average, both are fine. 

Why I am, I believe in giving you guidelines, I don't believe in giving you a rule because life, for example, vsc got hit even on 20 on this day but I did something and explain what. 

And I would tomorrow here to So, Whatever trails you take? 

Whatever trails you take? 

We follow one rule, follow one guideline don't makes that I today's I am trailing this with 10 or trailing. 

We are going to be 20, do it just follow one way for next, few trades. 

Like in the markets are Like in the markets are not moving, like, the market that we are in right now, moves are not before yesterday. 

A lot of moves on not even continuation, moves or not even going to to 10% in that market. 

Do I need wider stocks? 

So these are the common sense. 

It does you do that? 

I am not in this market. 

I am not going with. 

If I making money on one trade, even in this market. 

Like, for example, if I had NTPC NTPC, I, I bought on this day. 

Now, the whole the market is the whole entire market is bad. 

Well, in that environment when you are the loan, Well, in that environment when you are the loan wolf, when you ask is the loan rules, I don't want to be part of the loan wolf and and try to fight the bigger trend. 

So in this market, if I am here and the stock is here, then in this market, I can like how you judge the market will. 

Again, get better with time with again, with the trace. 

You take and the study of market breath with that you get will get better. 

And then that market, you can adjust that, you know, I don't want to leave trade with one with the 20 I can trilliant with 10 because highly like that, even 20 will not survive. 

So these are the things that you adjust with and I can I can like I am happy living, your rule that only trilli 10 then there will be a case where situation where you will get stopped out and miss the whose and there will be a situation where we will be same like in an empty PC was saved. 

So there is an advantage. 

There is a clear disadvantage like, but if I have a rule and if I followed it, then should I be upset? 

About should goes beyond that rule. 

It's easier right now for you to say it that no, I should not be but you will be upset because that's human behavior. 

This is what you have to work on consciously. 

Going back to the point paid positive. 

What can one people may? 

We can right and tell that initially even they went through this negativity or the fear or being website about trades going beyond that, okay? 

But today the very mature and they know that I am sure for this much. 

The end result is, I can grow my account faster, which is what we all here. 

What Whatever techniques you follow my technique, your technique, xy root technique, Whatever techniques you follow my technique, your technique, xy root technique. 

The end result is only one you want to grow your account fast, right? 

It happens. 

This way that way. 

Either you write 100% move or you write 10% more 10 times. 

The result is that you're growing your gone cost, right? 

So if I decide to Railway 10, then if it gets hit at 10 and goes on, don't worry about it. 

If it gets header 20 then don't worry about that. 

Why did not close that 10? 

I should have closed at 10 moving. 

Now, let's say you got this two narrow, is this val and you entered here, let's see your entered at in the first three minutes, you entered at 147. 

So in the next three days, if the next three days, why am I saying feed is because the average duration, or move goes on for is three to five days is three to five days and the average percentage move it goes on for is 15 into 20%. 

So whichever comes first. 

It will be the self 50% position at 15% but there is no guarantee that it will move. 

15%. 

What is the position does? 



10:25
And the position is at 8%, what to do cell, because you are already studied and gone through lot of names, not every stock So people who asked me in the during in this last week, the same thing that So, people who asked me in the during in this last week, the same thing that what to do, if the stocks are not going to 15% or where to sell. 

So this is your, this is the cell that you call that either. 

The stock will do 15% on the same day itself or maybe on the second day or maybe on third day. 

But if it's already three days and your position is struggling, ex only forward percent of 5% of 7% of, then I said at the end of 30, I will charge a lot of money to tell LIC is a Cell. 

This is not a class for that. 

So if you want to know the advice, pay me, good morning. 

All right. 

So either you self 50%, like in this case, which situation is true. 

If you entered here, which situation is true. 

The first one, we got 15% isly, it's an easy, 15% itself percent exit? 

Yeah, not time, waste time is time is when it's, let's say, I never more 15%. 

It only went to 13.94. 

Yeah, which I It only went to 13.94. 

Yeah, which I have a counselves, it only when two, three 13.94 and all the third day it is here or on the closing time, it's only 6% of. 

So, this is when I sell at 6%, I sell my cost 50% position because my intention is to immediately move to a state where I'm feeling comfortable with the trade. 

I asking you to wait for three days. 

But if someone who was honest Creed every second, looking at the price, which most of you do these three days is going But if someone who was honest Creed every second, looking at the price, which most of you do these three days is going to look like, or feel like three years, especially if you buyer 100, if you bad 100, and it goes to 110 and your target was 1112 stock. 

External going to help comes back to 103. 

You will be more. 

Hope you will continue to get answers and those three days, you might not even last. 

So what is the how do you survive those three days? 

How do you survive those three days? 

You take the trade, you put in your bits and close, the screen do. 

Not the screen time is not your friend. 

You only need screen. 

Time to execute your trades. 

Yeah, this is should always be after market hours because that is the time. 

When you can take good decision because things are not moving, you don't have money in world. 

Aur Vansh ka Man. 

Ke Roop movements are so fast especially if you have a big position, the moment. 

So pass that was human mind, especially when you are new. 

It is not capable of processing over information and connecting fast. 

So the only way I know of and this is how I do is you take the trade and you put in a your like you already know, target is 15% if you buying on Monday. 

Monday is your day one. 

If one day is your day one, when is your time based self Wednesday, right. 

So between Monday and Wednesday, there's no point looking at the treated at 11, one 11 or two, 11:30 12:30 12:45. 

All this is only going to rob you from your position. 

It will, then movements are so volatile that it will only Rob your from your position. 

The only time you can check your position is just few minutes before few minutes before closing. 

So that, you know, how strong the closing is, how strong the closing is. 

If you do not follow this, I can tell you continue to struggle and then you end up just missing out on news. 

Lot of stocks, even yesterday if you see the intraday chart of Amber and and Arora, they all of our moon, but Amber was not cleaner in the first few hours. 

If then went up broke out towards the end, but yeah intraday charge are only for execution. 

If you just keep looking at them inside, I don't even use intraday charts. 

And I have shown you that every beginning, I am only looking. 

Because once you can experience when market opening yesterday, this was the first 3 minute price action. 

If you are not looking at the intraday chart, how would the daily bar? 

Look like it would look like a full body, right at line. 

18979, 19, it would look like a full body and that is all I am looking for and looking for a strong start and after few minutes the price is near the high, the price. 

So you can. 

So now you can take help of this three minutes chart, but eventually you will not even require looping and all this. 

If it at 9 17, if I if I looking at, if I am looking at the daily chart that's all following I'm looking at, it is a strong opening. 

And the price is really trading at higher the day at 989 19 and then I just execute the trade. 

So looking at intraday chart only will Rob your from your position. 

So as a very clean start but I think I am about did not Amber was struggling here. 

So like, for example, if someone bought here 2 490 at 980 and then it's already, what, half an hour more than half an hour. 

It's like wave. 

Almost one position is still there and you see lot of struggles here. 

You see position struggling, right? 

Is this a sinus? 

If you just constantly looking at only, once you take the trade, as still on the screen, then yesterday, you would have cried looking at all this, you don't have any control for the movement of your stop. 

So, what is the point of looking at it? 

It is only going to give you make, you take bad decisions in you will, I mean, I am not seen in my experience. 

That people are taken a good decisions looking at this intraday chart. 

And then lot of times is a very mostly wrong decisions because you saw struggle on the three minutes chart and you came out of it. 

You ignore that on my daily, you are ignoring on a smaller frame, you giving him. 

This is two a smaller frame, but your ignoring that on a large sold that it has no choice but to Bounce, am I right? 

So yeah, this is what sitting on the screen us. 

So, the first rule is cell 50 position to 50% position at 15% or cell after three days which are all comes first for the remaining by. 

Now, I am not even waiting for 15% to raise my stock. 

If what is the percentage moves for a stock to offer in three days 15%, right? 

So now there is no harden, fast rule here. 

But let's say if you position is 5% up from your price, you buy a 100, you buying this strong start. 

Is this is a valid you buy this stock. 

Let's say here, and from that point is 4% up. 

Now let's say this, the price right now is 3262, if the price reverse is comes down to your, this level will. 

The bar look, really wish it will look like something like this this day. 

This is how it will look like, right? 

Is this? 

A bullish behavior? 

So if I say that raise it only after 5%, then you right now it's not 5%. 

And if it reverse is, you would get stopped out for me. 

It's a really huge body because it's a three digit stock. 

In most slow, I can show you on a smaller. 

Also, the ones which you want move fast, like Vizag moves, 4% 4.5% on an average everyday. 

Like, if my Mirza here on, I say can two days in on the same day, seller goes, 15% of the stock is 15% top. 

Should I still? 

Like let's say, forget 15. 

This is how the prices. 

The first thing that I going to do is my objective is go back to the notes. 

I want to first protect and being free mentally free. 

I want to first protect and being free mentally free. 

I want to protect my money and we mentally free this protection 10. 

If the stop get said, will save me from the losing Money, Plus mental capable, right, mental capital. 

It can also at times prove to be wrong because sometimes you get, stop will get hit and the position will again. 

Bounce back and continues to go higher. 

But two made that cell I made that cell rule responsible for this cell rule. 

It's me. 

The first thing that I do is I immediately movement stopped to cost ask I get three to five% moves, I'll bring my software cost. 

The first thing that I do is I immediately movement stopped to cost. 

Ask I get three to five% moves, I'll bring my software cost. 

If the markets are really, really week, I probably will raise it at 3%. 

If markets are strong, I don't want to give lot more like bigger moves because markets are healthy like yesterday. 

Yesterday was day, one of the Moon, I am, I am in those days. 

Even a big move is enough. 

So, I mean big room is enough, so maybe I'm not very raising my stock to make it simpler for you. 

In this case, in this case, I got a 91. 

I think 90, I don't exact, I was on a year. 

I think 90, I don't exact, I was on a year and right, after 90, when it went to, let's say 95, I bring my stop to 90 immediately. 

I am mentally free. 

I am not really worried about this position. 

I can move on to something else and I can concentrate on buying some other stock because pretty sure well lot of setups are there. 

Mirza is not the only one mov. 

We other stocks with lot of setups and I came into there. 

So the idea is to immediately, bring peace of mind and we mentally free. 

If your focus is on money, I can give you this like mindset. 

If you are focused on money, you are not going to make money. 

If youre focus on the process, if you focus on the process like you, there are good chances that you make money. 

For example, if a batsman like in the cricket, most of you must watching cricket. 

I do they really look at this. 

Let's score board agreement while the bat maybe at the time of changing they do. 

But when they are in the first thing then probably just focus on to play. 

Well, right? 

Am I right? 

So concentrate on feeding the mind with positivity and concentrate on falling the process. 

My process is that image when I am I should look for a chance to bring my shop to cost and then let the market decide what it was true. 

Or for me if it is a good stop it will continue to go higher and give me this. 

If it's a bad moves probably this is a really bad moves. 

It might just hit my break stop. 

If it's our gos move, it might just hit my stop loss and give me some loss. 



10:38
When the stock was, an idea is something. 

When the stock was an idea is something. 

And then it went higher, it did my first target is my first target done. 

After that, I trail by 20, because 20 gives bigger Trends here in this rice and selling 50% and it's already three days of move, right? 

Moving the same fashion, right? 

Is this some new way of moving or is the same way that we have already discussed? 

And then work on say right? 

Then after this small tip, I have another same. 

Behaviour, I get another 36% move in only three days, right? 

You have the choice to sell some more in this move. 

You are the choice to sell some more in this moon. 

What are we doing? 

We are selling into strength. 

When everyone's buying you The lot of liquidity. 

The lot of liquidity is easier to of load, break position. 

You can this concept right of liquidity, when the stock is going up, look at the volume. 

If you have big position, which you will have at some point in a future, you need selling into strength. 

If you start selling on these days, look at the volume. 

If, some of you are they can. 

If some of you are they can you need liquidity, just like reversals at the time of reversal, everyone selling. 

So it's easier to create a position. 

So, if you also want to at the, on the buy side, if you have big position selling into strength, this to be like you have to make this your friend, you have to sell when the stock is rising. 

Because I to 20 my stock is 95.45 for that position which is higher than my Because I to 20 my stock is 95.45 for that position which is higher than my cost price. 

What is the 20 ml value 95.45, right? 

Yes or no, fix higher again. 

Even so whatever. 

Open position. 

And as the most, this is how goes and now, And as the most, this is how goes. 

And now the first time the price it was 95.45 on this stage. 

Now my stop is 97.9 99.45 every day is I am training my soap, the stomach going higher, right? 

So on that 25% position you got it 90 you will already have good a good profit on the 75% position on the remaining. 

25 still have lot of money 189. 

Mm is on Mm is on closing basis and not just one closing, I'll show you why it is because markets not every movies. 

Perfect. 

There will be many times I can show you will last will ask of 2020 and even before that times of state around 20, and then bounst of and give a big. 

So what how do we handle, how do we analyze? 

What we do is like, if I say that closing, like, this is today, this is 17 December. 

And my stock is this Yellow line. 

And if I say that you have to follow on closing basis, but what is by closing is down to 97. 

And what is that intraday level? 

And what is that intraday level? 

It will be some points below this line. 

For example, this is 104 and this is the last swing. 

Is this the last string from where the most started? 

Let's say, I keeping reasonably below that line. 

Let me color it with red. 

Let me color it with red. 

This is my emergency stop, and this is my closing basis. 

If the stock stage below this line for few days more than 34 days, I need to give it three, four days. 

If it stay below this, and I'll probably close the trade while waiting for those three, four days. 

If it's my emergency stop, I am out immediately. 

What happened in this case? 

It continued higher after touching the 20ml line and offered more positions, is this valid set up and treat this. 

Let's say you already has one position here, you have 25 position position, left you treat this as a new position and same thing you getting 15% on one day. 

50% great. 

That you understanding that you sell half year. 

That you understanding that you sell half year and then it goes hire and higher and continue the same trailing rule that you followed here or follow for this. 

Stop this. 

I am left with 25% from here and let's say 50 to 25% got here and left with 25% position which I about here and a 50% to may be 25%, these are things that you I am left with 25% from here and let's say 50 to 25% got here and left with 25% position which I about here and a 50% to may be 25%. 

These are things that you decide on your own life. 

I want, I want to self 50%. 

I want to self. 

45%, I want to s%. 

Good point that, in this case, right now, in this new position, my copies already at cost for the remaining. 

Good point that in this case right now in this new position, my copies already at cost for the remaining. 

So my emergency stop at right now is the cost price. 

So, emergency stock is going to be either my price. 

I bought the stock here. 

A new entry stock goes higher. 

15%, my stock is, I book 50% and my remaining stop for the remaining position. 

Is that let's say cost price. 

My cost price is higher or the training, stop is higher. 

My cost price is higher or the training. 

Stop is higher cost Aaya, right? 

So I'm keeping this as my Store for now because why I am doing this, the common sense is I want to stay, you know, piece you want to be the loser in the trade, simple common sense that my Idea is to be a winner. 

Even if I make ₹1 ill or a you loser, if you want to be in that state, that you will know every trade or most of the tradees, maybe some trades are going to be small, going to be a big winners, but as long as I'm winning and or not losing money, I can tell you with my experience and other people also, get share their experience. 

That once few win, no matter a small amount. 

You still have a good confidence in your trading system. 

I just clarified, emergency stop is not on closing basis. 

Emergency is emergency, it's intraday. 

So now right now this is the emergency stock and this is the the line which is trailing soap because right now that this line is below my emergency stop. 

So I don't I follow this as my stop loss now which is higher the image I have now, my stock is 135 still 134. 

It gets it. 

And this is where I am out the entire position that I bought here. 

And here 25% left here. 

50% left here is completely out on this day. 

What is the move that I made 49% on this and 50% position on this and the remaining 50% got out at cost price? 

Are you getting this? 

I understand. 

And I know next selling is, I started on this note that selling is strikings selling is not stateful. 

You want state forward system, I can give you state for the system. 

Ask for it, dme, or telegram or Twitter. 

I'll give you state code system, but if changes happen, is market changes. 

The trend changes which they will. 

Then, don't come to me saying, that things around happening targets are meeting and all that, because you don't want guidelines, you want system, I can give you that. 

If you are want to be someone who can handle all the scenarios, then pay attention, initially you will be in the first six months. 

Like I said, in day one, you will be throwing darks in the air, hello? 

The side of a lot for me. 

This is the move. 

I been making on an average, so this unconvenient for the rest of my life and it works. 

And yes, it was even in this bad market till this build market. 

We getting moves of 10, 20 40%, let me show you. 

So you got this trade here, even initialize on this day, the trading stop is 69. 

So you got this trade here, even initialize on this day. 

Why am I giving you this big open ended? 

Because Because there is no guarantee. 

There is no guarantee that if you keep 64 in your safe. 

Is there any arrant at just, like to add point that if assistant case I'm sure there are lot of some of you are confused because like I said, selling is tricky and the jugaad better at it with the trade that you take. 

So the clarity will come with every trade but just in case to give it more clarity in today, I am I will write it down like a very very clear points. 

What difference situations what to do? 

Institution one? 

How to sell situation one and that. 

So it it will be the video is enough but just, you needed. 

I will do that. 

Also have written few things here. 

But as most situations comes out, I will share that all alone. 

Like, for example, we I this is a very recent started this year. 

Join 22. 

Let's say you got, is this a valid? 

Let's say you are in the Google and get into the first human as in the next three days in the next three days. 

It does your life, if it moves 10.79%. 

So you all the third day on the third day, your out, half position, and then it gave very, very good move after that, it moved 32% in only two days. 

Again, moving the same way as discussed, head moves in a fashion of three to five days. 

I shall. 

Because I know that this is two fast, a move, is this a normal move, or a very extended. 

When I say extended, I mean, as the average moon, or is on the higher side, it's only higher side, right? 

If I am getting something I aside and I have not locking games then I am leaving money on the table so I shall probably like I said I shall another 25%. 

So the trailing that I'm doing with 20 ma is not is only a Sun size, some 20% or 25% size. 

Why? 

Like let's say I I bought it here. 

Like let's say I I bought it here and I am outside already. 

I only have 25% left. 

Okay, and let's say, I rest.5%, when I bought you here, I just 0.5% of my portfolio. 

You remember the quantity calculative sheet, the risk that we take and it tells you the number of shares you want. 

Then I originally iris.5 and I am already out of 75%, I am only left with 25% which means I only left No.1 to five% risk position right now. 

This is today. 

What is my stock right now? 

For this open position A6. 

Who said 100, why is it 100? 

Who said 100? 

Why is it 100? 

I don't know. 

What is the logic? 

But anyway, the trailing stop for that remaining position is 26, MBA emergency with if it get intrading and any point in time I am out. 

So if your have a position, you place a bit in your system at 80 because we if this gets hit amount what is my material is going higher and higher? 



10:53
Let's see. 

Disposition is below this line, right? 

And it's a very, very minor day and it's only one day, this is known. 

As you need to wait for two, three days around this line to see a reaction how stock reacts around the slide because lot of good Trends you study the history, you study all the winners or 2021 2020 and you will find this income that lot of the all the winners majority of the winners have come around the 20mi line state around that line for a few days and then bounced. 

So if your following 20 mein line and not giving it some removed sometime, then you will be out from a position, a lot sooner and you have done big move. 

So in this case now all ad by now, where should my if this is my trailing stop where should my emergency means somewhere here. 

So let's say now my emergency is also higher and my closing basis this. 

Let's see what it does. 

So this is the first time, it has come and immediately. 

So this point of emergency and waiting for two, three days around that line, So this point of emergency and waiting for two, three days around that line saved me, and in fact, give me another buying point and I can tell you one thing, if you have a choice between buying a new stock aur adding to the one, which is already working. 

Well, I do the letter, I do the later and why? 

Because all this, while GMT has already, right? 

The other benefit is The other benefit is the other benefit is when you add to already working position, you have to manage less number of position, right? 

You have to track less number of positions, you have Limited only few names to track. 

Now, this is 148 is my training. 

I can bring my emergency to may be below this. 

This is the trailing I can bring my agency, even another those swing and mind you if your It's stock is more than 100% up. 

It's stock is more than 100% up, and if you count the basis, it's not a young, it's old more. 

So at this point at this point, when the stock was here, does it makes sense and you train X. 

The the same scenario that person a, the smarter one is selling into strength and not even trying to get the top, which no one can get no one can get person. 

Being is ignoring this old move, young move concept selling into strength. 

And, and just trailing and then he get stopped out. 

I am selling may be, let's say, on this day, the person be selling on this day. 

Not only, I sold higher. 

Not only a sold higher. 

I saved 18 days, these 18 days a lot of money, right? 

Time is a big factor. 

It's not just money. 

It's it's if you are blocked into a trade, which is already tired old and you just stretching it and this hoping from it and there is some other young which is going by aspay you and you are missing the money. 

There are missing the opportunity there. 

Like in this case for base, advocation is very clear. 

Like in this case for base, advocation is very clear. 

It's not very difficult to identify not but not all moves are this easy to identify. 

Some moves are very very difficult to give numbers to am I right? 

Not almost are very this. 

Clear? 

So in that case, what you can do is just see from where the was started. 

If this is a big base pay account, how far OB from there, how far is from there? 

And how much time have you studied? 

The slide. 

I shared a slide which is already here and shared with you guys. 

How much is too much. 

These are all the moves that I showed that not. 

It's, they say that stronger to buying force stronger. 

The result will be but it does not mean at stock goes up too much. 

I mean the strong goals are 300% 4% that's also good. 

That's not good. 

Mried, this is a 90% movement, 6 days. 

Mried. 

This is a 90% movement. 

6 days. 

All the narrow range. 

This narrow range did not work 48% in three days, So many narrates is 33% this one, I because it's a large name. 

So many narrates is 33% this one. 

So this This is a 35% move in, only two days, in only two. 

This is a 35% move in only two days in only two days so you would have taken it right? 

So, all these slides tell you how much is too much? 

This is a parabolic rice. 

Look at this 90%. 

The angle is also 90 degree 90% and 9 days after that. 

So many narrowings this and they should not big moves. 

No, big nose. 

Why? 

What is the reason behind it? 

There is a limited money in the market. 

There is a limited money in the market. 

There is no unlimited infinite amount of money in the market. 

There is a limited money, right? 

All the buying has been done. 

All the buying has been done two fast. 

So it means digestion time and I'll show you look at this 34% in four days 34% in four days. 

So many narrow range, this never it finally work at this year. 

At this point, why? 

Because now it has digested long enough of if you the answer is verified. 

How much consolidation is enough? 

I have shared goods. 

ATS you have good slides, compare with bad slides. 

Answer is there and plus you also go and pull up charts and see how much is good enough. 

The answer is very simple. 

If you are buying 34% move, right? 

When it's so fresh, it is not working. 

And now after a good amount of time spent now it started working look at this 54% in six days, not working because so fresh. 

If you go after this towards like after this slide open on tradingview I you will find it working again. 

Bad for the same reason because fast and Bad for the same reason because fast and not enough resting period not enough consolidation. 

Look at this. 

Yeah, this is what I wanted. 

So what the point I'm trying to make here is whenever you spotting a set up Get a repeat of that move. 

You need to give a You need to give a digesting like the stock should digest the move how much You need to give a digesting like the stock should digest the move. 

Like I'm sure this is the Like I'm sure this is the very obvious question. 

How much time should we give? 

I has shared the slide. 

I have shared the slide with you. 

How much is too much? 

I'll also shade slides of goods adopts, just seen count the number of days and find out the average. 

Or, or if you don't want to follow my slides, pick up past years there moving. 

After a 2025 days of resting period, they are not moving. 

Instant you like even in this case, maybe in one. 

Okay. 

Yeah, look at this, 37% in three days, you have this narrow range. 

They you would have taken it because you don't know this concept, we don't take it right? 

But this whole period, the whole period is only six or seven hours old, in my opinion. 

This is not enough. 

Rest, my opinion is, my study, says at least 15 days and there are good cases where it goes on for 2025 also, but definitely if I was seven day, a rarely works, I am not, I'm not going for a rare setup, I want something that is a more. 

When I was more often, how many bars 18 and then you get after a period of resting for 21, you get a moves on this day, which is in one day, it gave 7% and next 10%. 

Because went to let it go. 

Because went to let it go. 

The second is if from where the move started, if you are already some 7890 100%, The second is if from where the move started, if you are already some 7890 100% and very very fast, no make makes no sense and trailing that stop. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is, if you have a parabolic rise cell because that parabolic is going to kill the stock for many many weeks, this is the parabolic Rise. 

It killed the kill for these many days. 

So, huge time opportunity. 

Good evening. 

Finally after resting for these many days, you have a set up again, clear one, not big move but let's see where it. 

Finally Note, 8 note after big booms came after. 

So, 119 days Zomato is no example for this Zomato is not a continuation trade. 

I am not taking examples of that's for Q, and if you want to study examples, everyone appoint is okay. 

Again, this one, you have 45%. 

Stop rested for 17 bar before it started, but not 17. 

And this move came after And this move came after, this is more of 20% game after 21 resting period. 

For my point here is trail it when it's moving slowly along the line, like, J and BC was doing it. 

As soon as you see an angle like this, you see an angle like this, which we have already covered in day also what an extended on a climax move? 

Trading are objective, is to write the position for the shortest period of time, extract the full moon and come out of it and find next move because there are moves every day. 

Trading are objective is to write the position for the shortest period of time, extract the full moon and come out of it and find next move because there are moves every day. 

There are some sort of move every almost everyday. 

So if this is my, this this is, I will say 90% of her position or 80% here, or probably 100. 

If I have a new name setting up, okay, when we are sel 100l80, let's say on this day I have another position which is right their setting and I does it makes sense that I take out money from this and move to new name because of already it is going to. 

And look at this request, it did not move for seven days. 

Maybe in those seven days I could have made another 10 persons of is this clear? 

So this is when you let good. 

Old second is equivalent parabolic. 

You sell ad. 

The other third sign is how far away from the first base. 

If like, say the The other third sign is how far away from the first base. 

If like, say the Rise was smooth and no parabolic on the way how far away from the first page, if you not able to calculate the basis? 

Well, if you are already 100% up from the first base, we want to something else. 

You will find in this system, you know, going to get 500% moves 1000% more because that's not, we are targeting. 

We are targeting swings. 

Swings is 15 to 20% which you can repeat a lot more. 

Then finding one 100% or 200% or 5.00%, move in a year. 

How many 500% moves? 

Can you find or have you ever found? 



11:08
The problem is first, it is very difficult. 

It is very difficult to write that person. 

It if you are very small allocation, that 500% moves is not going to change your It. 

If you are very small allocation that 500% moves is not going to change. 

Your your game is not going to bring us the big back of your game. 

Instead, if you have 20% moves, which you can catch a lot more in one year with a good size, you will cross that you will be the person one person. 

Right now, after a rally of 2020, when we are up already 78% in this year, it's highly unlikely find big winners. 

Right now after a rally of 2020 when we are up already 78% in this year, it's highly unlikely find big winners stocks where which are going to 5x 6x you do the math and seat yourself which makes more sense to all the next is one more example. 

Like, let's say you got the stock here on this day itself valid up not as neat as all the other examples that you started. 

But let's say you go to here and inside this, how much did you get? 

Is it on the higher side or average side? 

What happens after you get 50% more based on your observations, on your homework? 

What happens after 50% move a cause or a fall? 

Your highly likely you started it in day one at your highly likely than the stock will waste your time. 

Now it will fill out. 

Yeah, so I will leave it on to you to decide what to do here. 

If I am, you I will probably cell 90% 85% to this. 

And then just leave the last part and trade and also buy. 

Why? 

Even that small portion I Even that small portion, I can give you that example like in. 

And also, if, when you have some possession left and it's sets of well, this is your next permitting. 

This is your next. 

And now from this long is we are 100% 133 already and it's not a fresh move. 

If there was adops, I would rather avoided. 

And if you see, this is also a 32% modes moves here, does not make sense prehing to whatever the last position that you are left with. 

And you avoid going through this dead phases, which is 57 days. 

The stock is not done much. 

It's digesting this whole moon now, after 57 days. 

Sorry, not 57. 

It's rain over now. 

Now probably if it's up again. 

I will consider because this is a good long digestion. 

Period. 

I hope this is clear. 

So that And we open about it, but just improvise after every And we open about it but just improvise after every mistake and then you reach a point where you make very few mistakes and you make good winners. 

So, to cut short, my selling is I sell. 

Also, Also and have an emergency stock have a emergency stop. 

So that a you don't get, there is a hard fall, you are just not waiting for the closing to happen because that in a, let's say, trading stock, at is 100, and it's all just, it's 9:30. 

A.m. 

the stock is already 100, by the time, it closing time 330. 

What is the stock goes to 90?
