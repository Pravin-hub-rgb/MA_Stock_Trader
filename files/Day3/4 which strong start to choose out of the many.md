# Which Strong Start to Choose Out of the Many

## Overview

When multiple stocks show strong start setups, selecting the best candidate requires systematic analysis of price action and behavior. This document outlines rules for choosing the strongest candidates from multiple options.

## Strong Start Selection Categories

### Strong Start Definition

#### 3-Minute Chart Analysis Rule
**When to Apply:** Use 3-minute charts to identify genuine strong starts.

**Why This Rule:** 3-minute charts provide immediate confirmation of strength and sustained bullish behavior.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Look for stocks that open strong and stay strong in first 3 minutes
- Price should close near the high of the 3-minute bar
- Avoid stocks that open weak or struggle during initial period

**Example:** A stock with 3-minute bar closing at the top indicates strong buying pressure.

#### Price Action Behavior Rule
**When to Apply:** Analyze how stocks behave during the opening period.

**Why This Rule:** Price action reveals the strength of buying interest and institutional participation.

**Key Indicators:**
- Closing near daily high in 3-minute timeframe
- Strong body formation in 3-minute chart
- Minimal wicks or shadows indicating sustained strength

**Behavior Analysis:** Stocks that maintain strength throughout the opening period show better conviction.

### Selection Framework

#### Multiple Candidate Rule
**When to Apply:** When multiple stocks present strong start opportunities.

**Why This Rule:** Having multiple options allows selection of the strongest candidate based on objective criteria.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Compare all available strong start candidates
- Rank candidates based on price action strength
- Choose the stock showing the most robust behavior

**Decision Process:** Systematic comparison prevents emotional or random selection.

#### Probability-Based Choice Rule
**When to Apply:** Select candidates based on probability of success.

**Why This Rule:** Stronger price action increases the likelihood of successful trades.

**Key Indicators:**
- Stocks closing at daily highs vs. those closing lower
- Clean price action vs. choppy or struggling behavior
- Consistent strength vs. intermittent weakness

**Probability Assessment:** Stronger candidates statistically have higher success rates.

### Decision Criteria

#### Daily Chart Analysis Rule
**When to Apply:** Examine daily charts to confirm 3-minute analysis.

**Why This Rule:** Daily charts provide context and confirm the significance of 3-minute behavior.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Look for daily candles with strong bodies
- Identify stocks with minimal upper wicks
- Avoid stocks with large shadows indicating weakness

**Chart Confirmation:** Daily analysis validates 3-minute observations.

#### Common Sense Application Rule
**When to Apply:** Use logical reasoning to choose between candidates.

**Why This Rule:** Trading requires practical decision-making based on observable facts.

**Key Guidelines:**
- Choose stocks that are clearly stronger
- Avoid marginal or questionable candidates
- Apply simple logic: strong behavior > weak behavior

**Practical Approach:** Don't overcomplicate - pick the obviously stronger candidate.

## Implementation Framework

1. **Initial Scan:** Identify all potential strong start candidates
2. **3-Minute Analysis:** Examine opening behavior on 3-minute charts
3. **Daily Confirmation:** Verify strength on daily timeframe
4. **Comparison:** Rank candidates based on strength indicators
5. **Selection:** Choose the strongest candidate for entry

## Key Principles

- **Objective Analysis:** Base decisions on observable price action
- **Strength Preference:** Always choose the stronger candidate
- **Time-Based Confirmation:** Use 3-minute charts for immediate validation
- **Common Sense:** Apply logical reasoning to trading decisions
- **Probability Focus:** Select candidates with higher success probability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Random Selection:** Choosing without systematic analysis
2. **Emotional Bias:** Picking familiar stocks over stronger candidates
3. **Ignoring Price Action:** Not examining actual trading behavior
4. **Overcomplication:** Making simple decisions unnecessarily complex
5. **Weak Candidates:** Settling for marginal setups when better ones exist

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Clear Strong Start
**Stock A:** Opens at daily high, closes at daily high, strong 3-minute bar
**Stock B:** Opens weak, struggles to gain ground, closes lower in 3-minute timeframe
**Selection:** Choose Stock A based on clear strength indicators

### Example 2: Sector-Based Choice
**Multiple Metal Stocks:** All showing strong starts
**Selection:** Choose the one with strongest 3-minute behavior and daily confirmation

### Example 3: Quality vs. Quantity
**7-8 Candidates Available:** Don't trade all, select only the strongest 1-2
**Selection:** Quality over quantity - focus on best opportunities

## Conclusion

Choosing between multiple strong start candidates requires systematic analysis of price action, 3-minute behavior, and daily confirmation. By applying these rules consistently, traders can select the highest-probability setups and improve overall trading results. The key is objective analysis and choosing the obviously stronger candidate rather than settling for marginal opportunities.
