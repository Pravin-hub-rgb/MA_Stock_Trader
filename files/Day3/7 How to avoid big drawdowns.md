# How to Avoid Big Drawdowns

## Overview

Managing drawdowns is critical for long-term trading success. This document outlines systematic rules for preventing large losses and maintaining consistent account growth through proper risk management and psychological discipline.

## Drawdown Prevention Categories

### Loss Limit Rules

#### 5% Drawdown Stop Rule
**When to Apply:** Stop trading immediately after losing 5% of account capital.

**Why This Rule:** Prevents small losses from compounding into large drawdowns that are difficult to recover from.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **Immediate Action:** Stop trading for 10 days after 5% loss
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine if losses are due to poor setups or market conditions
- **Recovery Protocol:** Return to trading only after proper rest and analysis

**Recovery Strategy:** "If you lose even at this level then you probably take may be because we are in a very, very mad market scenario"

#### Small Loss Prevention Rule
**When to Apply:** Focus on preventing small losses from accumulating into big drawdowns.

**Why This Rule:** Small losses add up quickly and can turn into significant drawdowns before realizing the problem.

**Key Indicators:**
- Multiple small losses in a short period
- Consistent stop-loss hits without follow-through
- Market conditions not supporting trading strategy

**Prevention Method:** "The small losses will add up and they will turn into a big drawdown reserve even realize"

### Risk Management Rules

#### Position Size Reduction Rule
**When to Apply:** Reduce position size after experiencing losses.

**Why This Rule:** Smaller positions reduce risk while rebuilding confidence and capital.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **Initial Reduction:** From 0.5% risk to 0.25% risk per trade
- **Further Reduction:** If losses continue, reduce to even smaller sizes
- **Gradual Increase:** Only increase size after consistent profitability returns

**Risk Adjustment:** "Let's say, time if I was creating with 10 lakhs, now I trade with 5 lakhs, or if I was trading with 0.5% risk, now, I'm trading with 0.25%"

#### Mental Capital Protection Rule
**When to Apply:** Prioritize mental well-being over immediate profit recovery.

**Why This Rule:** Trading with emotional baggage leads to poor decision-making and further losses.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **Break Period:** Take time off after significant losses
- **Clear Mind:** Return to trading only when mentally fresh
- **No Revenge Trading:** Avoid trying to immediately recover losses

**Mental Recovery:** "I'm giving time to myself to come up. Come back to the king slate"

### Market Condition Rules

#### Market Recovery Recognition Rule
**When to Apply:** Recognize when market conditions are not favorable for trading.

**Why This Rule:** Fighting against unfavorable market conditions increases drawdown risk.

**Key Indicators:**
- Multiple consecutive losing trades despite good setups
- Market volatility making normal strategies ineffective
- Stocks not following expected patterns

**Market Assessment:** "If I don't realize it, if I don't accepted FM, still going for it, then I am just basically going into a rough, right? Bumpy road"

#### Break Period Implementation Rule
**When to Apply:** Take planned breaks when market conditions deteriorate.

**Why This Rule:** Markets need time to settle, and traders need time to reset.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **Duration:** 10-day break after 5% drawdown
- **Market Observation:** Monitor market during break without trading
- **Return Strategy:** Come back with reduced risk and fresh perspective

**Recovery Time:** "I can, I am giving market to set. I'm giving time to market to settle down"

### Recovery Strategy Rules

#### Gradual Recovery Rule
**When to Apply:** Recover from drawdowns gradually rather than aggressively.

**Why This Rule:** Aggressive recovery attempts often lead to larger losses.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **Conservative Approach:** Use smaller position sizes during recovery
- **Patience Required:** Accept that recovery takes time
- **Consistency First:** Focus on consistent small gains before increasing risk

**Recovery Mindset:** "It's a lot easier to recover from a 2% or 3% or 5% drawdown"

#### Single Digit Drawdown Rule
**When to Apply:** Keep drawdowns in single digits to maintain recovery ability.

**Why This Rule:** Double-digit drawdowns require significantly higher returns just to break even.

**Key Calculations:**
- 10% loss requires 11.1% gain to break even
- 20% loss requires 25% gain to break even
- 50% loss requires 100% gain to break even

**Mathematical Reality:** "You can do the maths. You can share that numbers with you"

## Key Principles

- **Emotional Discipline:** Protect mental capital as much as financial capital
- **Market Respect:** Recognize when market conditions require stepping back
- **Gradual Approach:** Slow and steady recovery beats aggressive attempts
