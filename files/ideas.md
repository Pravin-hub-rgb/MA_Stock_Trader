for reversals what we can do is ..
like see 
if we will notice a lower wick we buy each time???
may be like on that low if price moves back up a certain percentage .. that shows that the price is moving up .. on daily chart we will se lower wick so we buy it??? 


don't fix the range of reversal scanner?? like 3-8 days .. there can be stocks where they are down more than 8 days...
